         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To all that deſire to live godly in CHRIST JESUS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not unknown to very many of Gods people in this Nation, with what entire affection, and happy ſucceſs, the pious Authour of theſe Meditations, now aſleep in Jeſus, laid out himſelf in the ſervice of the Goſpel. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of you <hi>ſate ſomtimes under the ſhadow of his Miniſtry with great delight.</hi> And of thoſe who had not the enjoyment of him, but in more removed diſtances, what ſerious eye ever read, as it ought, that truly incomparable piece, <hi>The Deſerted Souls Caſe and Cure,</hi> and was not thereby enlightned, ſtartled, humbled, lifted up nearer to God? Or what good heart, for that end that it might be better, duly peruſed his later piece <hi>Of Faith and Sight,</hi> but it was by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed <hi>faith,</hi> and its <hi>juſt appendages,</hi> more fitted for ſight? The Holy Spirit was his <hi>ſpring,</hi> and plentiful <hi>emanations</hi> from thence filled his <hi>Ciſtern,</hi> and made him free to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> He dwelt in the preſence of Chriſt, d ſo was at home in Heavenly Negotiations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:169957:4"/> and the content that he had there made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſtand ſtill between Chriſt and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to receive and give, though he gave away his own life withall. And when he perceived the ſhadow of the evening to be ſtretched forth upon him, they did nothing to him, but only provoke him to make more haſte in the finiſhing of his work. Thoſe holy <hi>Tapers,</hi> which receive their light from the golden <hi>Lamp</hi> of the Sanctuary, ſhine and burn down to the ſocket, and are burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining lights thereto.</p>
            <p>In his wearineſſes, and weakneſſes, grown conſtant in his later time, when the effects of his pains made ſtrong ſollicitations to deſiſt, it was an expreſsion, which he often uſed with pleaſance to his friends, <hi>Yet praying and preaching is too good work to be weary of.</hi> In the continuance of it, he <hi>poured forth</hi> himſelf as a <hi>drink-offering</hi> to Chriſt upon the ſervice of his Saints, and ſo paſſed to eternal life, through the beſt forms of death. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that way (as is roported of <hi>Moſes</hi>) God doth <hi>kiſs away the ſouls of his Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that he might prevent death, he took much pains with his <hi>own pen,</hi> beſides conſtant expence of mony for the aſsiſtance of <hi>another,</hi> that his <hi>love</hi> in permanent teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies might out-live his life, and the firſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of his hearers. He knew well how precious diſcourſes are loſt to the inconſiderate part of
<pb facs="tcp:169957:4"/> men and women, who either do not give <hi>due heed</hi> while a Sermon is preached, and ſo take it not into their underſtandings and hearts, or elſe <hi>cannot remember</hi> it, having heard it but once. Of his good will to ſuch, he hath left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evidences which will be produced, if God pleaſes, as ſoon as time, health, and other work will give leave to make up the Chaſin's, and mend other errours of the writer, in thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies which were taken from the Pulpit, and were not corrected by himſelfe: For the preſent it was judged meet, to print theſe three ſmall Tracts.</p>
            <p>The firſt touching <hi>Spiritual remembrance</hi> of God, as a moſt <hi>ſeaſonable praelibation;</hi> This being a time, when a <hi>careleſs</hi> Devil hath after too eminent a manner poſſeſſed a multitude of Profeſſours, and many Chriſtians have <hi>reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly</hi> loſt Jeſus Chriſt in the crowd of worldly affections, deſignes, diverſions. The aim of this is to quicken all that have the root of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life in them to more frequent Addreſſes of Soul to God, and to rivet them in contentful abode, and holy repoſes in him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is an excellent diſcovery of <hi>the Saints intereſt in God,</hi> in which all holy ſouls may ſee how happy they <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>may be</hi> in God, <hi>their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> holds forth <hi>Gods intereſt in us,</hi> by which, as by a true glaſs, we may learn to
<pb facs="tcp:169957:5"/> reflect upon God all his goodneſs, and love, contained in the former Treatiſe, if it be alſo revealed in our hearts, and ſo God will be to us, as he is to all true Chriſtians, the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of our life.</p>
            <p>All which Diſcourſes the Godly Reader will find enrich'd with many <hi>clear deſcriptions</hi> of heavenly truths, many rational <hi>conſiderations,</hi> which in way of Exhortation do ſtrike fitly and weightily upon thoſe capable principles which God hath put into the ſoul, as <hi>Ears</hi> for him to take hold of, both with very lovely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, and right dreadful terrours: and as he goes up and down, he will meet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall and ſure directions, like <hi>benigne Guides,</hi> telling the way of happy life to all the children of wiſdom and truth. So you have a ſhort account of what you may find in theſe papers.</p>
            <p>Be their <hi>Patronage</hi> the living influence of the <hi>all-quickning Spirit,</hi> who only is able to make theſe, and all other well-ordered tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, effectual to their deſirable ends, and who can <hi>protect</hi> them from <hi>unprofitable reading</hi> and <hi>forgetful neglects,</hi> which are the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful abuſes and unjuſt impriſonment of the moſt uſeful truths. I, who in this matter do only carry the ſtaff of <hi>Eliſha</hi> which he hath left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, <hi>do</hi> and <hi>ſhall</hi> pray, that it may not only be laid upon the child, which is ready to <hi>dye,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169957:5"/> but that this Spirit would joyn himſelf to it, and make it the miniſtration of life, even the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>bands</hi> of God upon the ſpirits of his own. That the miſplaced eye of ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be ſet right, and then fixed; that ſome heart may be undeceived. And Oh that the time were come, when no Child of God would write his name in the earth, which to do is to be curſed, and to make the Divels ſport. Alas! whil'ſt we through their falſe repreſentations, and cozening impulſes ſell our comfort, our life, our ſoul for cheap things, at eaſie rates, do they not laugh? do they not inſult? Though it is a poor ſport, and proper only to Divels to rejoyce in the follies and ſorrows of humanity. The Lord Jeſus, who came to break the power of ſpiritual wickedneſſes, drive them out of the ſouls of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and if they muſt have leave to enter any where, let it be onely into ſwine. The Lord appear more to the Inhabitants of this world, that they may ſee the glory of truth, and be transformed into its Image, delivered into the ſpirit and life of truth, and out of the power of detaining falſhoods, and ſeducing vanities, the chains of evil ſpirits. Then the capacity of the children of men ſo empty, hungry, and ſore diſtreſſed, (though ſome are ſenſleſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perceive it not) will be filled with God. Then a <hi>Strand</hi> will be ſet to that deplorable forgetfulneſs of God, which hath <hi>ſwell'd</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:169957:6"/> ſuch unreaſonable heights, that it hath left the tops of very few mountains diſcernable above it. Then thoſe which have pure minds will be ſtirred up to run after their Lord: The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom will enjoy more of the promiſes, and by them partake of a Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in greater meaſures, inherit more of the holy Land, trade in true life, be tyed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Galleries, having <hi>their</hi> eyes ſet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon Chriſt, who with <hi>his,</hi> will take away their hearts, and keep them with himſelf, and be a Covering of the eyes to them from all falſe ones for ever. I have no more to adde, but the continuance of theſe wiſhes, and prayers, humbly begging a remembrance alſo in yours, for,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Pſalm is a Pſalm of ſpeciall excellency, and hath this mark on it, that (as ſome others) its form'd in Verſes of it according to the Hebrew Alphabet. <hi>David</hi> was a man of a heavenly ſpirit, and truly he breaths much life in every word. This Pſalm is a Prayer; <hi>David</hi> complains of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169957:11"/> Enemies; good men ſhal never want them, but this is their advantage, that as the world wil be ſure to be their enemie, ſo God wil be more ſure to be their friend. He had one to go to and could tel him how it was with him, and how men dealt with him, and that's but a bad buſineſs to the world, but its a great relief to the Spirits of the Saints, that they can go to God and ſpeak their hearts. And in his Prayer obſerve his ſpirit: He doth not after the manner of the world, breathe out Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons moved meerly from the ſmart of the ſtroke, without ſenſe of the cauſe; but cries out more of his ſin then of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſpeaks more againſt himſelf then againſt his enemies, and begs more that he might walk in the ſight of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and have his favor, then to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from his enemies. And as all Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the more ſpiritual, the more argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative it is, (Prayer that is full of Affection, is full of Arguments;) ſo this. But while <hi>David</hi> was drawing down mercy upon himſelf, he was catcht up; Love fires in Prayer. His Faith is quickened in Prayer, and then Love's inflam'd: In the midſt of his Prayer he breaks out and tells God in the words of the Text, that his eyes were ever towards him: While he was begging
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169957:11"/> the eye of God toward him, he tells God, <hi>Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ever,]</hi> You cannot underſtand that actually and unceſſantly his thoughts and heart were towards God, and his mind taken up with him; for by the neceſſity of this life, and the Law of it, he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be taken up with other things: But when he ſays, <hi>Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord,</hi> he means theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the diſpoſition of his Soul was ſuch, that he could be always looking upon God; he could wiſh, that when he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of himſelf, and got up, that he might never come down more, and never have any other work in the world but this, to behold God. Thus <hi>always</hi> is taken in the Scriptures. In <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2. <hi>Cornelius</hi> is ſaid to <hi>pray [always,]</hi> that is, he had a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his heart was ready to pray always. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. It's ſaid of the Jews, <hi>They were ſtiff-necked and hard-hearted [always] to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> this was their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: like a ſtone that reſiſts the hand of the workman, takes in no impreſſion, but is wholly ſhut up to it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When he ſaith, <hi>Mine eyes are always towards the Lord,</hi> he means this, That upon all occaſions, in every condition, in all places, his eyes were towards God. In
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169957:12"/> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. Chriſt teacheth to <hi>watch and pray always,</hi> that is, upon all occaſions, when ever Prayer is called for; watch to ſee the ſeaſon, and have your hearts open: <hi>Making mention of you Always in my prayer,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. and not ſeldom elſewhere; that is, as I have occaſion I do intercede for you, as I pray for my ſelf, its my dayly work: So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.9. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day will I praiſe thee. Pſal.</hi> 145.2. <hi>Every day will I bleſs thee:</hi> So here, <hi>Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord,</hi> that is, it's my every days work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Mine eyes are [ever] toward the Lord,</hi> that is, continually; it is not only my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary work and dayly courſe, but it's a work that ſhall laſt while I live, a work for life. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.10. <hi>David</hi> ſaith concerning <hi>Mephiboſheth, He ſhall [Always] eat bread at my table;</hi> that is, while he lives he ſhall ſit at my table: And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.2. <hi>While I live</hi> (he ſpeaks in the ſence of the Text) <hi>I will praiſe thee.</hi> So that now here you have the temper and practiſe of a godly man, his <hi>eyes are Ever toward the Lord.</hi> The Text holds forth theſe three things to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is upon which the eyes of Saints are ſet, upon what they are termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; upon God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their great diligence and aſſiduity

               <p>Eying of God, in Scripture expreſſion, as it's taken in a large ſence, it's put for the mind of man, and not only for the mind, but for the heart; eying, ſeeing, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſignifies all manner of Affections<note n="a" place="margin">Sub ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine omnes affectus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari non ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt. <hi>Calv.</hi> in loc.</note>.

               <p n="2">2. Minding of God is a <hi>willing work,</hi> the will is in it; there be many thoughts fly at <hi>random,</hi> they get out of the Mind, but are not <hi>ſent out:</hi> The Mind of a Man is a moſt <hi>profuſe</hi> thing, and nothing in the world ſpreadeth it ſelf into ſo many act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as the <hi>Mind</hi> doth: The <hi>Sun</hi> is not ſo full of <hi>beams,</hi> as the <hi>Mind</hi> is full of <hi>thoughts,</hi> which ſpreads it ſelf more then a thouſand Suns.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169957:16"/> God, as a <hi>meſſenger</hi> ſent and driven out upon an <hi>unwelcome</hi> meſſage, in a way, and to a perſon whom he loves not: Many caſt an eye ſometime upon God, becauſe they think they muſt not always live in forgetfulneſs of him; they do it as a <hi>duty,</hi> not a <hi>refreſhment</hi> to them; as a work, not wages; becauſe they <hi>muſt</hi> do it, not becauſe they <hi>love</hi> it. Yet by ſome men God will be thought on, though they would not: The <hi>Devils</hi> cannot forget God; God hath made ſuch a <hi>ſtamp</hi> of himſelf upon their natures, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget him; that's their unhappineſs; they wiſh they could be out of Gods <hi>ſight,</hi> and God out of theirs; and if it could be, their miſery would be the leſs.

But the more a man that is right finds a conjunction of God and his mind, the more ſweet it is to him; he reckons this like the gate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſuch a day is as one of the days of Heaven: When the Soul is thus taken with God, it loves every glance of God; the more it ſees, the more it loves: <hi>Abraham

               <p>As for the <hi>godly,</hi> their frequent excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from God, their inordinate affections to the world, their ſad dejections of ſpirit, their many withdrawings, and a world of theſe, are too clear and deplorable <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations</hi> that their eyes are not <hi>always</hi> upon God.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>In not ſending out</hi> the underſtanding toward God, not pointing of the mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its Maker: The mind of man is a <hi>nimble</hi> thing, nothing is of that agility; it's the <hi>ſwifteſt</hi> creature God hath made, next the <hi>Angels;</hi> yet towards God it muſt be <hi>moved,</hi> directed, ordered, and pointed.

It's a great fault, that a man loſeth that <hi>watch</hi> and that <hi>command</hi> over his ſpirit which he ſhould have, ſo that his mind either <hi>ſtands ſtill,</hi> as a lake, or if it move, it runs at <hi>waſte;</hi> as indeed a mans mind doth, if it be not toward God and for God: A great fault it is when men take not <hi>pains</hi> with themſelves, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complains, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.7. <hi>No man ſtirs up himſelf to take hold on God.</hi> It's ſaid in <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.28. <hi>They came every one whoſe heart ſtir'd him up.</hi> Your hearts had need

Were theſe <hi>golden Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> given you, and have you the keys of them, that you ſhould keep them empty, when you might fill them with <hi>heavenly</hi> treaſure, which is invaluable? <hi>David</hi> calls his Soul his <hi>glory;</hi> you <hi>ſtain</hi> the crown of your <hi>glory,</hi> when you make ſuch glorious creatures to lacquey after every creature, which ſhould be in attendance upon God, like Angels in the preſence of their Father. When the mind runs after vanity, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vain: <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. <hi>What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they run far from me, and walk after vanity, and are become vain?</hi> The vain out-goings of your minds and ſpirits will make you vain, yea worſe then nothing. What injury do you do your ſelves, that have ſuch nimble <hi>winged</hi> meſſengers, (that can mount up to the higheſt Heavens, can walk with Angels, can lodg themſelves in the boſom of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169957:21"/> glorious God, can preſent all your Caſes to him, can bring back again reports of mercy to you,) if you uſe them not? Do you not ſee, how God is <hi>ſending</hi> out to you continually? The thoughts of his heart are Love, eternal Love; and the fruits of his Love are always ſent out, like the beams of the Sun: He hath ſent out his own Son, and will not you <hi>ſend</hi> out your thoughts towards him? Will not you order your thoughts toward him, who hath directed his greateſt Love towards you? What is your life, but a continual <hi>emanation</hi> and emiſſion of divine Love?

I ask you that queſtion, which Chriſt put to ſome in another caſe, <hi>What went you out to ſee?</hi> When you crawl and move, as if you had no <hi>heart,</hi> nor ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whom go you forth to ſee? What, <hi>him</hi> that is the Lord of Glory, the only Potentate? What are ſuch heavy and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy aſpects, to take in ſuch a Glory? You ſee in what large ſtreams your thoughts fly forth to other things, and are you only languiſhing, weak and feeble in things of ſo great concernment? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver, that hath in his flock the ſound and the ſtrong, but offers the blind and lame.</hi> Certainly this is the way to procure a curſe, to be ſo exceeding <hi>remiſs</hi> in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God; hence it is you get no more: Then God comes moſt to the <hi>heart,</hi> when the eyes are moſt ſet upon him: The child that draws with <hi>ſtrength</hi> is ſooneſt filled: The Breſts of Conſolation are full, but therefore you are <hi>empty</hi> and complain,

               <p n="3">3. As this is a <hi>fault,</hi> not to ſend our your minds toward God, and not to bend your minds to the work; ſo this is another, the not <hi>binding of your minds</hi> to it: You ſhould not only <hi>go</hi> to God, but <hi>ſtay</hi> with him. The right minding of God, is not a <hi>tranſient</hi> glance, and ſudden caſt of the eye, that is preſently wheel'd off from God again. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.5. <hi>I remember the days of old, I meditate on all thy works:</hi> I remember them, and not only bring them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but I meditate on them, my mind talks of them;<note place="margin">

God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth ſomething upon record to be done; they confeſt that <hi>their tranſgreſsions were

Though a man ſhould give a <hi>thouſand</hi> glances every day toward Heaven, if there be no <hi>effectual</hi> impreſſion upon the heart, God takes it as if a man <hi>ever</hi> lookt from him, and <hi>never</hi> caſt an eye toward him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. They are called <hi>a people that forget God:</hi> Surely 'twas not a <hi>total</hi> forgetfulneſs; for the Law of God <hi>was in their mouths,</hi> and they had made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with him by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but their remembrance of God was not <hi>effectual,</hi> it did not ſubdue their hearts to God: therefore though they talkt of him, yet God chargeth them with forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of him. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. the Apoſtle ſaith, that they that <hi>live in ſin, have not ſeen God, neither known him:</hi> A true ſight o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. upon this account reckons, <hi>It's no more I, but ſin that dwelleth in me;</hi> becauſe the propention of my ſpirit, my better part, is all towards God, it is no more <hi>I:</hi> In this ſence, when a wicked man thinks of God, it's not the <hi>man</hi> that doth it, but his <hi>conſcience,</hi> or the <hi>power of God</hi> upon him; he doth what he would not do. As in another caſe,<note place="margin">Quae quia non potuit non facit illa facit.</note> when a man <hi>would</hi> do a thing, though he <hi>cannot</hi> do it, it goes for <hi>done</hi> with God; as it's ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning his ſon, and <hi>David</hi> concerning the <hi>temple:</hi> So that whether it be good or evil, it's not reckoned if the <hi>will</hi> be not in it.

               <p n="3">3. That which is not done <hi>according to the Rule,</hi> God reckons it as not done.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169957:34"/> which <hi>is next to it:</hi> ſo an unregenerate man loves that beſt which is <hi>worſe;</hi> and hence they give themſelves up to all <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> ſetting open their Souls, and proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves to every thing that is evil, and become a common <hi>habitation</hi> and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place for every thing that is not good; and the more <hi>unlike</hi> any thing is to God, the <hi>better</hi> entertainment the heart of man gives it: By this <hi>voluntary tradition</hi> of himſelf, he is ſo captivated to thoſe things that he had once a power over, and his back ſo bowed down, and he ſo held under, that he <hi>cannot</hi> come out of this ſtate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God bring him out: That in <hi>Mark</hi> 6. doth ſomething reſemble the ſtate of theſe men, They <hi>were in the deſart, where were many comers and goers, and they had no leaſure to eat:</hi> It's ſo with worldly men, they have <hi>many</hi> thoughts coming and going, that they have no <hi>leaſure</hi> to do that which is beſt for them.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169957:34"/> ſo he works ſtrongly: He is ſaid <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. to <hi>work effectually in the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> Where he hath poſſeſſion of the mind, he picks up the ſeed ſown, that it may take no root, nor ſpring up; he <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſeth</hi> the mind, and holds it in perpetual employment; like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> that was made to ſerve in a <hi>mill:</hi> ſo Satan makes the Soul to run a <hi>round</hi> which way pleaſeth him, that it hath no time nor leaſure to look towards God, which is a very ſad thing: <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.2. It's ſaid of <hi>Judas, The Devil having put into his heart to betray Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> When once the Devil hath got the <hi>regiment</hi> of a poor creature in that kind, he puts in and puts out at pleaſure; and the truth is, when he put this thought into <hi>Judas,</hi> Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entered into him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. he came in with thoſe thoughts, he entered when they entered, and then the man was perpetually and mightily <hi>employed</hi> by him. The <hi>mind</hi> of man is naturally fruitful in thoughts, tending <hi>from</hi> God: <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, Mat.</hi> 15.19. It is with the <hi>nature</hi> of man, as 'tis with ſome <hi>ground,</hi> that brings forth ſome things of it <hi>ſelf;</hi> but if it be <hi>dreſt</hi> by a skilful man, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds much more. When Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the <hi>Gardiner</hi> of the Soul, every plant there <hi>multiplies</hi> and fructifies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169957:35"/> and there will be a mighty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Hence it is, that man lives in a <hi>courſe of forgetfulneſs</hi> of God, becauſe by a <hi>voluntary</hi> diverting of himſelf from God, at length God is provoked to <hi>divert</hi> from him, and then <hi>Satan</hi> takes <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of the heart and thoughts, he enters and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the man at his pleaſure.</p>

               <p>LIve in a more <hi>cloſe attendance upon God:</hi> You never live rightly, till you live in the world as in a place <hi>conſecrated</hi> to God. It's an extream wrong to the <hi>end</hi> of our Being, when we let our minds <hi>looſe</hi> unto vanity: To be extravagant and open to vanity, is worſe then that the <hi>Temple</hi> ſhould have been opened to all abominations. This work is little regarded in the world, little of it is done: The Children of the <hi>night</hi> are <hi>altogether</hi> in the dark, and ſhut out from God; the Children of the <hi>light</hi> very <hi>much</hi> found in forgetfulneſs of him: And truly theſe days in ſpecial manner abound with this <hi>fault;</hi> men ſtand more <hi>remote</hi> from God now then ever: <hi>Forgetfulneſs</hi> of him <hi>from</hi> whom all our Being is, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169957:36"/> 
                  <hi>upon</hi> whom we all depend, <hi>reigns;</hi> yea much of it is there where men think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be raiſed moſt unto God, and brought into more conformity to him, and communion with him. My counſel to you is, to look to your <hi>eyes: My eye</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is ever towards the Lord:</hi> And oh that all <hi>our eyes</hi> were ſo fixed. The <hi>work</hi> that I now call for is, the willing, holy and frequent <hi>emanation</hi> and outgoing of your minds towards God, and contentful and effectual abode with him. I ſhall give you a few <hi>Arguments</hi> to preſs this <hi>Duty;</hi> and indeed we had need have Arguments urg'd with all force, and it's well if a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Arguments draw one man; the moſt argumentative diſcourſe in the world is not ſtrong enough alone to prevail with men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt <hi>Argument</hi> is from the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the work;</hi> it's that which you <hi>may do,</hi> it's a work poſſible, it's a work that you have <hi>power</hi> to do: When God calls for your <hi>eyes,</hi> it ſuppoſeth your eyes are not ſo <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>faſtened</hi> in your heads, not ſo fixt and immovable, but you may look up to him, you <hi>may eye</hi> him and mind him; God never gave a Command <hi>impoſsible:</hi> But here is this <hi>threefold fault,</hi> which I'le but touch.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:169957:36"/>
               <p>That men having underſtandings to mind God, their <hi>minds ſtand ſtill</hi> like ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, or like a <hi>clock</hi> whoſe wheels move not at all; which fault however ſometimes it may be from a meer <hi>diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> yet oftentimes it is from a <hi>ſinful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:</hi> There is no <hi>liſt</hi> in mens hearts to look to God, nay there is a <hi>withdrawing</hi> from God, and rather then the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be employ'd upon God, it ſhall run at <hi>waſte</hi> (like water,) or ſtand ſtill, and not move.</p>
               <p>Men <hi>ſometimes</hi> do look to God, but as it's not their <hi>dayly courſe,</hi> ſo they do it not with <hi>ſtrength,</hi> but weakly and faintly: <hi>Slight viſions</hi> leave but very <hi>ſhallow impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:</hi> Theſe men live according to the ſight they have of God; Slight men are of poor ſpirits, becauſe they do not <hi>enoble</hi> themſelves in a vigorous beholding God.</p>
               <p>A <hi>third fault,</hi> which is worſt of all, when men <hi>ſend</hi> out their thoughts and lay out their underſtandings in an <hi>ill way,</hi> when the <hi>matter</hi> of their thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations is <hi>evil.</hi> There are thoughts of good that are evil thoughts, and thoughts of evil that are good: When a mans <hi>mind looks</hi> on God, but the heart <hi>withdraws,</hi> when it looks upon God with contradictions and quarrellings at him, theſe are <hi>evil</hi> thoughts
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169957:37"/> of God. There are thoughts of <hi>evil</hi> that are good, as when a man looks on evil, but his <hi>end</hi> is the ſeparation of his heart from it, and that he may deſtroy it.

This faculty is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and herein differs much from the actions of the body, which have their <hi>ſeaſons,</hi> their proper time and place; but the acts of the Soul may be done in any place, at any time; you may ſtart into Heaven when no eye ſees you; you may be on the wing towards God, though among a croud of men; no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſuch but you may be with God, and yet your buſineſs not ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> It's an <hi>eternal faculty,</hi> and the work of it is everlaſting: A contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life is the <hi>life of Heaven,</hi> it's that which Angels do; they <hi>ever behold the face of your Father in Heaven.</hi> If you like not this work, how will you live in Heaven? The diſlike of it is a <hi>bar</hi> againſt your entrance: The life of bleſſedneſs is a life of <hi>Viſion,</hi> and ſeeing God; which if you take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, Heaven is no place for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> It's a faculty <hi>very active;</hi> your minds muſt be <hi>ſomewhere elſe,</hi> if they be not with God; and if they be not on God, they are upon ſomething of <hi>leſs</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Why ſhould you follow after drops,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169957:39"/> and neglect the Fountain? Why ſhould you fly after ſhadows, and neglect him who is the true Subſtance? Truly if the mind have its current from God towards other things, theſe things are not only of leſs concernment, but <hi>deſtructive,</hi> and from whence you will reap nothing but <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and depravation, and defilement of ſpirit; you will grow worſe and worſe into the form of the Devil, by how much your minds ſtray from God, and pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other things: <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. <hi>They are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> It's a faculty that hath received in the Saints a <hi>tendency</hi> towards God. You do extreamly wrong your ſelves, when you make not uſe of that <hi>propenſity,</hi> and put not forth your ſelves to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, whereby you might bleſs your ſelves in the enjoyment of him. See how <hi>David</hi> expreſſes the <hi>propenſity</hi> of his ſpirit towards God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee, my Soul thirſts for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee: When ſhall I come and appear before thee, to behold thy Glory, as I have ſeen it in the Sanctuary?</hi> This is the courſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the children of God, in whom that <hi>propenſity</hi> which was <hi>natural,</hi> is now in part
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169957:40"/> 
                  <hi>reſtored;</hi> ſo that they are bent towards God, they thirſt after God; as a man thirſts for water in a dry and thirſty Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> There is a <hi>bleſsing in this work:</hi> God bleſſeth what he likes, as he curſeth what he hateth: He likes it well. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and a book of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and thought on his Name.</hi> He will be ſure to mind thoſe that <hi>mind</hi> him, and be a friend to thoſe that ſeek after him. When you are bid to look upon him, it is but to <hi>receive</hi> from him: Is it any thing elſe, but to call and invite you to look on the moſt pleaſing and delightful Object, that in the beholding of it, it may convey it ſelf unto you, and you be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and filled with it? It is all one as if he ſhould bid you ſit down by a Well of Life, and drink, and to be as Chriſt and the Angels are, who are bleſſed in the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding</hi> of him; as if he ſhould bid you come and pluck Apples off that <hi>Tree of Life</hi> that is in the midſt of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God <hi>loves this work:</hi> Cant. 2.14. <hi>Let me ſee thy face, my Beloved, and hear thy voyce, for thy voyce is ſweet, and thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance comely.</hi> In one act you may do that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169957:40"/> which <hi>pleaſeth</hi> God, and makes you bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Set your eye towards him, and his eye will be more towards you, and he will refreſh you as with Manna; there is enough in him, come and take freely: Reflect upon your own <hi>experience,</hi> have you ever found this way like a <hi>wilderneſs?</hi> If it be a bleſſed work, why will you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſs your ſelves? If the work will exalt you, why will you debaſe your ſelves in not cloſing with it? And if you might live above in Heaven, why will you live below? Let all the ſweetneſs you have ever found in this work provoke you to enlarge your ſelf toward it. When thoughts of God are moving in you, God himſelf is not far off, he will come and enter too; and how ſweet is it for God to come and take up his habitation in the Soul?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt a Pattern of Eying the Father. Greateſt mindfulneſs of God due. God our beſt Friend. All we have is in his hands, and of his gift. All Religion founded upon a due mindfulneſs of God. Anguiſh awails wandering hearts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANother Argument</hi> is from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Lord Jeſus, whom we are to mind and imitate; He is your <hi>Pattern:</hi> What ſaith Chriſt? <hi>Learn of Me:</hi> And, <hi>Be you perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> How can you follow Chriſt the <hi>Captain</hi> of your Salvation, if you mind him not? When the Apoſtle perſwades them in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. to <hi>run the race that is ſet before them,</hi> he bids them <hi>look to Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of their Faith.</hi> Mariners at Sea, that they may run a right courſe, keep an eye on that ſhip that bears the <hi>light.</hi> Your courſe cannot be right, when your eye is not upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> your Pattern. Would it be with us as it is, when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of God lodgeth in our hearts, if we did more mind Chriſt? We ſhould ſay in our ſelves, Is this the courſe that he ſteered? <hi>David</hi> tells us of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:169957:41"/> 16.8. that he <hi>ſet the Lord always before him;</hi> or as <hi>Luke</hi> expounds it, applying thoſe words to Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.25. <hi>I foreſaw the Lord always before my face:</hi> The Father was Ever in his eye; whatſoever came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſight, he ey'd him firſt, and fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Now Chriſt is not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be our Pattern in this thing, but he takes notice of us, whether we imitate or no; His eye is upon us, to ſee whether our eye be upon the Father, as his was and is for ever. It was the counſel of <hi>Seneca,</hi> that when men are about to do evil, they ſhould think on <hi>Plato,</hi> or ſome ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent man, as preſent to behold them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if Chriſt were more minded, as ſuch a Pattern, God would be more the object of our moſt affectionate thoughts.</p>
               <p>Again, If we conſider the Object, it is the greateſt reaſon in the world that our eye ſhould be upon God: God is our <hi>friend,</hi> he loves us, he bears us in his heart; and ſhall not he be in our <hi>thoughts?</hi> This is ill requiting of him, whoſe eye is <hi>always</hi> on us, ſeldom or <hi>never</hi> to eye him: This is a great contradiction to the <hi>Law of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> which conſiſts in <hi>reciprocation</hi> of loves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11. <hi>I know my thoughts toward you</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end:</hi> Oh that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169957:42"/> we could ſay ſo, I know my thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, are thoughts of <hi>love</hi> and care to pleaſe him: <hi>Job</hi> 19.14. See how hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly <hi>Job</hi> took it, that his friends had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him, <hi>My kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As God is your <hi>friend,</hi> ſo all you have is <hi>in his hand: My times,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 31. <hi>are in thy hands, O God:</hi> And can you forget him, in whoſe <hi>hands</hi> are all your concernments? If you had but a piece of your <hi>eſtate</hi> in a mans hand, you could not but mind him. God hath <hi>all</hi> that you have for Soul and body to Eternity in his hands, and ſhall we forget him? It was the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the ſin of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.23. that he did not glorifie God, in whoſe hands his life was; <hi>Thy God, in whoſe hands thy breath is, thou haſt not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, You have <hi>all from him;</hi> all the good of every kind that you receive, is all from God, and will you not <hi>mind</hi> him? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.18. God complains, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were <hi>unmindful of the Rock that begot them, and forgot God that formed them.</hi> Shall we ſo diſhonor our ſelves, and live ſo croſs to all principles of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and Juſtice, as to be taken with the <hi>things</hi> we receive from God, and <hi>forget him?</hi> Shall we <hi>receive</hi> all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169957:42"/> that comes from him, and <hi>ſhut</hi> him out of doors? It was never Gods intent, that when he had deckt our ways with all flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of comfort, we ſhould ſink into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>unmindfulneſs</hi> of him: Theſe are ſo many <hi>memento's</hi> to excite us to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him. It was the commendation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Heb.</hi> 11. that he ſojourned in the Land of Promiſe, <hi>as in a ſtrange Country:</hi> He did not ſit down as at <hi>home,</hi> and make glad his heart in the enjoyment of mercies; but reckoned himſelf as in a ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that he might enjoy <hi>him</hi> that is better then all.</p>
               <p>It is upon record, that God had ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to his own people the Jews, <hi>Beware leſt you forget me, when you come into that good Land:</hi> It is ſpoken to you alſo, Take heed you forget not me in your habitations, in your relations and friends, in your goods, in all your enjoyments. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.21. <hi>Thou art my ſervant, O Iſrael; I have formed thee, thou art my ſervant, thou ſhalt not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of me;</hi> or not forget me: the force of the word is, thou ſhalt not <hi>bear me away,</hi>

Thus you ſee much in him, whom you are to mind, to draw and hold your eyes toward him.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:169957:43"/>
               <p>The laſt <hi>Argument:</hi> It is a very <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Duty;</hi> all your intentions, purpoſes, diſpoſitions and affections in your whole courſe comes to nothing, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive life from this, for this is the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all: In the ſight of God lies your <hi>Rule</hi> of direction for all your actions, and all the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of your holy walking: The mind is the Leader, and it leads according to the <hi>object</hi> where it is ſet. <hi>Job</hi> 31.7. <hi>My heart hath not followed my eye:</hi> That is the natural courſe, for the heart to follow the eye; where the eye is ſet, there the heart will be alſo. See how the Prophet expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.2. <hi>I have ſtretched out my hand to a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good; they follow their own thoughts.</hi> They <hi>walkt in a way that was not good;</hi> What led them?

Upon all theſe conſiderations, and many more that might be urged, give up your ſelves unto this work: There is not a man free, but the bonds of this counſel are upon him. The ſum of it is this, Often have your eye on God, dwell in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of him, let that day be as one of the days of Hell and of darkneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have nothing to do with God: This is certain, if God be your God, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not let your minds run at waſte: To turn aſide from God, will be very chargeable and expenſive to you, you will pay dear for it: Children that wander from home get the <hi>rod:</hi> The rod is not far from that man that loves not to ſtay with God.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Directions concerning Eying of God. Truths to be received in their power. Saints are to keep in their hearts a meetneſs for their work. Saints are to preſerve their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for God. Saints muſt maintain a deep ſenſe of divine engagements. A lively ſenſe of neceſsities is uſeful. Pure hearts are meet for divine converſe. The mind will'd without Sanctification.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Shall now ſet before you ſome <hi>helpful Counſel,</hi> that may enable to this great work, from which the heart of man doth ſo hang off. Certainly there is nothing which men are more hardly brought to, then to this, to keep the <hi>remembrance of God</hi> freſh in their ſpirits, and to let their underſtandings run in this <hi>channel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. As men do intend an <hi>end,</hi> ſo they eye the <hi>means;</hi> indeed the means lie in the way to the end, yea they are the way it ſelf, and the end is in them: I will therefore offer ſome means to you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Entertain the Rule in the power of it:</hi> When any Command of God comes <hi>armed</hi> with his own ſtrength, it makes man weak, he cannot make reſiſtance, but falls
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169957:45"/> down <hi>conquered</hi> in the aſſault. The heart <hi>naturally</hi> ſtands out againſt and is eſtranged to every voyce of God; it will give him the hearing, and admit the ſound, but not the <hi>ſtrength;</hi> it will keep the Word at a diſtance, either by non-attending, or by voluntary diverſions and forgetfulneſs. Indeed the things of God are very <hi>ſtrange</hi> to us, though they were our <hi>beſt and neareſt acquaintance</hi> in our <hi>primitive</hi> ſtate; and therefore now we are hardly brought to own them and receive them.</p>
               <p>The not entertaining of the Truth in the <hi>power</hi> of it, is that which fruſtrates ſo many thouſand Sermons; ſo that though everyday one thing or other is called for and preſſed, yet matters are as they were: God ſpeaks, but few regard; he cals, but few anſwer; He ſaith, Do this, and do that, but all is undone ſtill. Then the Word and Counſel of God is received in its <hi>power,</hi> when a man doth <hi>acknowledg it,</hi> and hath the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the weight and efficacy of it; and this was the commendation of them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. that they receive the Goſpel, <hi>not in word only, but in power:</hi> and what was the effect of it? ſee verſ. 6. <hi>And they became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction.</hi> And obſerve, <hi>John</hi> 8.37. what the Reaſon was that the Jews were in

               <p>The <hi>ſecond thing</hi> that I would commend to you, is this, To get and keep your hearts in a <hi>meetneſs and fitneſs</hi> for this work: As God hath put work on his people, ſo he doth expect that there ſhould be a fitneſs in them for it; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>A veſſel made meet for his Maſters uſe and ſervice.</hi> I will expreſs this <hi>meetneſs</hi> in a few <hi>particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One is, to keep the mind as <hi>free</hi> as you can: Our underſtandings, though they are <hi>mighty things,</hi> yet they are <hi>limited:</hi> When they are held much unto <hi>other things,</hi> there cannot be much of them left for God:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169957:47"/> Take heed of being too <hi>prodigal,</hi> in cutting out too large portions of your ſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: When you fill your ſpirits with the world,<note place="margin">Intus exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens prohibet alienum.</note> you are put into an <hi>incapacity</hi> of communion with God; that which is within, keeps out that which is without: Mark what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be over-charged with ſurfeiting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with the cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares.</hi> What ever doth put you out of <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of your ſelves, what ever <hi>incapacitates</hi> you to that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereunto you are called, theſe things, as you would not have the evil day come upon you unawares, are to be taken heed of. O what a dread is it to the Soul of a man, when the evil day, the day of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, the day of temptation, eſpecially when the day of diſſolution comes on him before he looks for it? while he is buſie in the world, in hunting after this and that vanity, ſnatcht away, like a fiſh taken in the net that it lookt not for? The cares and the pleaſures of this world are unto the ſpirit of a man as <hi>wine;</hi> it doth <hi>intoxicate,</hi> and put a man out of himſelf, and under the power of <hi>Satan;</hi> he is a man in <hi>bonds;</hi> the Devil hath his foot upon his head, and his hand upon his heart; he hath the <hi>poſſeſsion</hi>

The <hi>effuſion</hi> of your ſelf upon the creature weakens you towards God; that as a <hi>drunken</hi> man, that hath not the uſe of his limbs, nor of his Reaſon, that is like a <hi>child</hi> in ſtrength, and a <hi>fool</hi> in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo is a man whoſe mind is cut out and ſhared among the creatures; he is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, that he cannot draw near to him. The body cannot be in two places at once; and your underſtandings and ſpirits cannot be <hi>ſtrongly</hi> in Heaven, and <hi>ſtrongly</hi> in the world: The ſtreams will run ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but one way; If you will therefore be in the world, you muſt be content to own your ſelves <hi>baniſhed</hi> from God: You have ſet your ſelves from God, you make your ſelves <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to your own life, and put
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169957:48"/> your ſelves at a diſtance from your own eternal good. Take heed therefore of fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves with the world; take heed of ſinful fulneſs: worldly <hi>fulneſs</hi> takes up the whole <hi>capacity</hi> of the Soul, that there will be no <hi>room</hi> left for God. Tell me I pray you, what uſe are your <hi>Chryſtal glaſſes</hi> for? do you keep them to be filled with puddle water? Will you fill your <hi>ſtomacks</hi> with chaff or carrion? and will you fill your precious and glorious <hi>minds,</hi> thoſe high and excellent creatures, with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the world, nay the things of Hell it ſelf? Take heed of <hi>prepoſſeſsing</hi> your ſelves; for if you be not <hi>free,</hi> we ſpeak to dead men; it is all one to bid you look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, as to bid a deaf man look Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when his eyes are fixed Weſtward; it is all one to bid a man walk with God and in mindfulneſs of him, as to bid a man that is bound in chains of Iron, riſe up and walk.</p>

                  <hi>Another thing</hi> is, Maintain in your ſelves <hi>a deep ſenſe of thoſe divine Engagements</hi> that lie upon you: Indeed we have all of us many bonds upon us, but yet we are too free and diſobliged to God; and whence is it, but becauſe we forget our Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>

               <p>They that are taken with the glory of divine goodneſs, cannot keep themſelves from the remembrance of it; nay they will force on themſelves, and ſpur up all their powers unto it: <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me bleſs his holy Name: Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not all his benefits, Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 2. If you would mind <hi>mercies</hi> more, you would mind more the <hi>God of mercies:</hi> If you did remember the ſweetneſs and fulneſs of this <hi>ſtream</hi> of grace by which you are maintained, you would eye more the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> from whence they flow; and if you would get your ſelves under the <hi>engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this love, it would <hi>conſtrain</hi> you, that you could not live forgetters of God, but your eye would turn <hi>readily</hi> toward him: If we were ſenſible of our engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, could we deny God that <hi>attendance</hi> that he calls for from us as his ſervants?

                  <hi>Again,</hi> Keep your hearts <hi>pure,</hi> and then you will be meet for this work: <hi>Guilt</hi> brings fear, and fear brings <hi>torment.</hi> The natural effect of <hi>guilt</hi> is <hi>flying</hi> and hiding from God, and <hi>dying</hi> in our ſelves: <hi>Adam</hi> would not be ſeen when he had ſinned: <hi>David</hi> was afraid to come before God when under <hi>guilt:</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. ſee how he did contend with fear; Go, ſaith <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and fall down before that God againſt whom thou haſt ſinned: I dare not, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I am afraid to ſtand in his preſence; he ſaith it was his torment; <hi>for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me, my moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was turned into the drought of ſummer:</hi> ſo in verſ. 5. <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my ſins:</hi> Fear ſaid, Do not; but ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I will do this. But this is ſure, a man that hath a ſpirit that is ſullied by ſin, a ſpirit that hath <hi>guilt</hi> upon it, a man that is under the power of an accuſing Conſcience, that man will be afraid of God, as a Priſoner of the Judg: And certainly ſometimes if God did not by a mighty power <hi>draw</hi> in his people, they would rather hazard their eternal life, then <hi>look up,</hi> when they have lift up their heel againſt him; ſo dreadful is the ſight of God, that it exceeds the ſtrength of any creature, not only the <hi>natural</hi> ſtrength, but alſo the <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> It is with man in this caſe,

See what is ſaid in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20. The people ſinned, and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto the people, <hi>Fear not; ye have done all this wickedneſs, yet turn not aſide from following the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your hearts: and turn not aſide, for then ſhall you go after vain things, that cannot profit, nor deliver, for they are vain: For the Lord will not forſake his people, &amp;c.</hi> He ſaw ſuch a <hi>diſpoſition</hi> in them, that through <hi>diſcouragement</hi> of heart finding themſelves in ſin, they were ready to <hi>ſink</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> off from their attendance and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto God; and therefore he gives this counſel, by no means to harken to this ſuggeſtion of an evil and a torturing ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Let me add this as <hi>another means,</hi> That you muſt <hi>pray for ſanctification of mind:</hi> What a ſtrange <hi>wilde</hi> thing is the mind of man by nature? <hi>Sanctification</hi> is the taming, the compoſing, the ordering and ſeaſoning of the underſtanding; it is the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169957:52"/> bringing of the mind into a right frame, and the ſetting of it in its <hi>proper courſe;</hi> until that be, it lies open for <hi>all comers;</hi> all the powers of darkneſs ſnatch, and catch, and rend it in pieces, and bear it away, and every vanity commands it: but when grace comes, that <hi>appropriates</hi> it unto God, ſo that it becomes the Lords. Therefore pray for <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which is the <hi>induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new nature</hi> into the ſpirits of a man, and a <hi>new propenſity;</hi> ſo that as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it had its <hi>tendency</hi> towards <hi>vanity,</hi> now it will have its <hi>tendency</hi> toward God. <hi>Sanctification</hi> is a great thing: What is the <hi>body</hi> until Sanctification comes, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed <hi>monſter,</hi> as a wilde beaſt? O with what numberleſs outragious paſſions doth it blind and carry away the Soul? Until it be ſanctified, it puts a man into an incapacity of converſing with God; it lies not only open to all <hi>temptations,</hi> but it ſnatcheth after them; it's a weight that lies upon the ſpirit of a man. Pray for <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> which is the <hi>ſequeſtration</hi> of the ſpirit of a man from vanity, and the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration</hi> of it unto God; it is the putting of it into his <hi>poſſeſsion,</hi> the planting in it a new diſpoſition to move towards God, and to converſe with God: this the Apoſtle calls <hi>the renewing of the mind.</hi>

                  <p>Advantages that come by minding of God, are to be duly conſidered. The more we mind God, the more we may. Thoſe which eye God moſt, know themſelves beſt.

This will make you know your ſelves <hi>more:</hi> for when your eye is on <hi>God,</hi> it is upon your <hi>Rule,</hi> the Rule of all perfection, the moſt abſolute <hi>Pattern</hi> of all <hi>ſpiritual beauty;</hi> therefore you may ſee what <hi>proportion</hi> and ſimilitude there is between God and you: This will breed a ſelf-<hi>abhorrency,</hi> becauſe of that infinite <hi>diſagreement</hi> that is in the ſpirit of a man and his ways to the holy God: <hi>Job</hi> in the ſight of God abhor'd himſelf <hi>in duſt and aſhes, Job</hi> 42.4. Here you may ſee how your hearts and the Rule agree.</p>
               <p>Now alſo you may obſerve what <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions</hi> the ſight of God leaveth upon you. You ſay you mind God: Well; and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169957:54"/> I pray what comes of it? what fear? what faith? what hope? what tenderneſs? What watchfulneſs is there wrought in your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by your minding of God? What a hard heart is that which is layd under the very beams of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and melts not? What an obdurate ſpirit is that which in the ſight of God yields no more? We ſhould come to ſee better what we are, if we were more in this work.</p>
               <p>This <hi>advantage</hi> too you ſhall have, you ſhall be <hi>filled more with God:</hi> What is the moaning of your Souls? O, ſaith the Saint, that I might enjoy him! O that God might be my God! and that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence might be with me where ever I am! All ſpiritual <hi>life</hi> hath its <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>growth</hi> in this work; the <hi>firſt</hi> ſight of God lays the <hi>foundation,</hi> all <hi>after</hi>-ſights do <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct:</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> ſight of God is the <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of holineſs in the Soul, <hi>after</hi>-ſights are <hi>waterings</hi> unto more encreaſe and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; at the <hi>firſt</hi> ſight of God, God <hi>enters</hi> into the Soul, but the <hi>after</hi>-ſights of God <hi>fills</hi> and fills until they fill up the Soul. If therefore it be ſo great an <hi>advantage,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, and let it provoke you unto this work.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Rule</hi> more to help unto this work; <hi>Poſſeſs your ſelves deeply with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169957:54"/> of the great ſinfulneſs</hi> of the neglect of this: Therefore men and their ſins are ſo near together, becauſe they ſee not their ſins more ſinful; When ſin appears <hi>out of meaſure ſinful,</hi> then it ſets the heart at the greateſt diſtance from it. Look on the <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> of it in the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it: Whence is it, thou wandering Soul, thou ſleeping ſpirit, thou man poſſeſſed with the world, that thou ſayſt thou breatheſt after God, and yet ſhutteſt thy eye from him? It is from a moſt woful <hi>frame</hi> of ſpirit: Faith is dead, and love dead; all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of life are put into a ſtate of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it is <hi>deep night;</hi> all the ſpiritual powers are aſleep, bound up; hence it is thou mindeſt God no more. Poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thou art not thy ſelf, thy heart is gone, other things have born it away; thou art like the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> until God brings thee unto thy wits and right mind again.</p>
               <p>Now ſee what the ſtate of that man is, by the true <hi>original</hi> of the ſin of neglecting to remember God; and look a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into this matter, to ſee it in the <hi>Effect</hi> of it: Forgetting of God <hi>diſſolves the bond</hi> between the Soul and God, and ſets it <hi>free</hi> from God: It is the minding of God that doth beget and preſerve a <hi>capacity</hi> of him, and <hi>propenſity</hi> toward him; then forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169957:55"/> of God ſhuts up thy heart from him, and doth byaſs thy Soul unto a <hi>contrary motion,</hi> to a departing from him, puts thee into a ſtate wherein thou canſt not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the calling whereunto thou art called: Thou canſt not walk in the place of a <hi>ſervant</hi> toward thy Lord; for how canſt thou do his Will whom thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereſt not? If all the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of holy walking lies in this, then the nerves and ſinews of Holineſs are <hi>cut in ſunder,</hi> when forgetfulneſs of God raigns in men. There is this <hi>evil</hi> alſo, thou <hi>betrayeſt</hi> thy Soul as much as in thee lies into the ſtate of the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves: What makes Hell, but want of God? and what makes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of Devils, but ſeparation from God? And this thou doſt practiſe upon thy own ſelf. I could give a notorious and ſad Inſtance of this truth to every one that doth voluntarily forget God, in an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Profeſſor whom I knew, who ſaid, The turning point and firſt beginning of his declining from God, was his neglect of communion with Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore when you give your ſelves to a voluntary forgetfulneſs of God, you <hi>betray</hi> your ſelves into a ſtate of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding from God; and if once the Devil get the <hi>poſſeſsion,</hi> and can back thy ſpirit, he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169957:55"/> will <hi>ride</hi> thee poſt into the pit where there is no bottom, and from whence there is no return. I will ſhut up all with that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt forgotten the God of thy Salvation, and haſt not been mindful of the Rock of thy ſtrength, therefore ſhalt thou plant pleaſant plants, and ſhall ſet it with ſtrange ſlips: In the day ſhalt thou make thy plants to grow, and in the morning ſhalt thou make thy ſeed to flouriſh; but the Harveſt ſhall be a heap in the day of grief and of deſperate ſorrow.</hi> You may in your forgetfulneſs of God enjoy your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, trim up this world to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and make all your ways like pleaſant walks in delightful gardens; you may make your paths to be as fruitful fields; But what ſhall the end be? When the Harveſt comes in the appointed time thereof, there ſhall be <hi>a heap in the day of grief and of deſperate ſorrow.</hi> If you would have a Harveſt of Rejoycing, if you would reap that which may be the Refreſhing of your Souls, if you would not ſow gall and wormwood for you to reap hereafter, take heed of betraying your ſelves into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of God.</p>

                  <p>Intereſt in God the true Spring of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How it is Propriety with Community. Beſt, becauſe God is beſt by a Confluence of all Excellencies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Church was now ſad, and there was cauſe enough, for God frown'd upon her; If ſhe look'd upward, ſhe ſaw God diſpleaſed; if downward, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but violence, one devouring another
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169957:56"/> with the tongue and with the hand: And therefore ſhe makes her retreat unto God; <hi>[Therefore,]</hi> becauſe men are ſo injurious, ſo falſe, ſo treacherous, <hi>therefore I'le look to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's an excellent ſpirit which is in the Saints, that the world knows not of; they make ſuch <hi>Therefores,</hi> ſuch <hi>Concluſions</hi> as the world is not acquainted with: The <hi>froward</hi> man ſays, <hi>Therefore</hi> I'le do ſo too; the <hi>politick</hi> man ſays, <hi>Therefore</hi> I'le be wiſe, and look to my ſelf; the <hi>good man</hi> ſays, <hi>Therefore</hi> I'le look to the Lord. Obſerve how the evils of this world put the Saints upon the improvement of their power with God, and how the ſight of propriety in God gives ſtrength and life to the ſpirits of Saints; <hi>I'le look up, I'le wait for the God of my Salvation, my God will hear me.</hi> That which I am to ſpeak to then, is,</p>
               <p>That the ſight of God, as our God, is that which lifts up our heads and chears our hearts againſt all diſcouragements, and carries us through all difficulties, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is diſmall: When a man can ſay, God is mine, that man ſhall live when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe lives.</p>
               <p>I'le give you ſome few Foundations of this.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing I'le inſtance in, is, That
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169957:57"/> this propriety of the Saints is a <hi>propriety</hi> with <hi>community;</hi> there is much in that: In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Unto the Church of God which is at Corinth, ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Saints, with all that call upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, both theirs and ours.</hi> The force of this lies thus; That which ſerves for <hi>moſt</hi> is <hi>beſt:</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> is better then a <hi>Tapor;</hi> becauſe that ſerves <hi>all,</hi> the other ſerves but <hi>one,</hi> or a <hi>few:</hi> A <hi>Spring</hi> is better then a <hi>Ciſtern,</hi> becauſe <hi>all</hi> my drink of <hi>that,</hi> but <hi>few</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi> That which all want is beſt; Univerſal want ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that thing which we need to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally good. That may be wanting to one man, which another wants not: A Mariner may want a <hi>rudder,</hi> or a <hi>ſail,</hi> which others want not; but all men want <hi>bread:</hi> That thing is good to him, but this is good to all. This Propriety therefore being with Community, to wit, that God is not my God alone, but of all the Saints in Heaven and in Earth, and of all the Angels; this ſhews, that a Propriety and Intereſt in God is the beſt Propriety: Hence it is, that the Saints having their portion in ſuch an one are ſo refreſhed, and their comforts much advanced, becauſe they know that others drink of the ſame River of Life together with them.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:169957:57"/>
               <p>Secondly, This Propriety is in that which is beſt, by a Confluence of all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things: As for example, Love, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Kindneſs, there is none like that which is in God; here it is tranſcendent: You may reaſon ſo, not only from what God <hi>is,</hi> an infinite Being, but from what God <hi>doth.</hi> Look on thoſe high <hi>operations</hi> of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> you ſhall ſee they are clear demonſtrations of his <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> the moſt excellent things have flowed from thence; <hi>Pardon</hi> of ſin, <hi>Peace</hi> that paſſeth all underſtanding, and everlaſting <hi>life;</hi> theſe have flowed from this Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. God in his Love hath gone to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ſet it out; He never intended ſo full a demonſtration of his Power, as of his Love; Therefore though he hath not gone to the utmoſt of his Power, yet he hath gone to the utmoſt of his Love: It's Love that paſſeth knowledg, all knowledg, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. It's poſſible to imagine how ſome things in the Creation might have ſhewn forth more of the <hi>Power</hi> of God, as if he had made men equal power with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp;c. But it's not deviſable, which way there ſhould be a greater demonſtration of his <hi>Love,</hi> then he hath ſhewn; partly in what is the enjoyment of his Saints in this world, but principally in that which he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169957:58"/> hath promiſed in the other. Now where the greateſt Goodneſs and Love is, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in that Perſon is moſt precious and excellent. There is in God a <hi>deſcending Love:</hi> You ſhall ſeldom find, that love in a child carries that worth and excellency in it, as the Love of a Father doth; becauſe deſcending love chiefly ſeeks the good of another, <hi>aſcending</hi> love ſeeks our own good: The love of God greater, becauſe deſcending love.</p>
               <p>Further, There is not only <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in God, but <hi>Wiſdom</hi> alſo for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging of theſe; this adds to the Propriety. The beſt Prince may not have wiſdom enough to know all his Subjects: but God knows all his, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>I know my ſheep, and am known of them.</hi> He that tells the ſtars, and calls them all by their names, knows every one of his, and their caſes; he knows what fears, what wants, what preſſures, what ſtraits they are in: <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous out of all their troubles,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Again, He is preſent with all his; all things in the world are confined and limited, God only is every where: The Sun reacheth to the whole Hemiſphere; But Gods Power is infinite, and himſelf omnipreſent; He fills Heaven and Earth, He is not confin'd
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169957:58"/> to any place, or limited within any bounds; Therefore to have a Propriety or Intereſt in this God, muſt needs be a very great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and Conſolation.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Intereſt in God of a perfect extent to all in God. Gods love laſts, is not broke off by offences, is not hindered by diſtance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God effectual to all good ends. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine friendſhip not burdenſom.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Propriety that the Saints have in God is <hi>perfect;</hi> I mean, it <hi>extends throughout</hi> to all that God is. Among friends and acquaintance this is the Law, their friendſhip reacheth to <hi>ſome</hi> things, not to <hi>all;</hi> but the Intereſt of the wife and children reacheth to the full compaſs of the husbands eſtate: Much more our Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in God reacheth to all that God is. As the Law of Communion between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son was this, <hi>John</hi> 17.10. <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine:</hi> So is the Law of the Intereſt between Chriſt and his people; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. All things are yours,</hi> becauſe all is Chriſts. If there be enough in God for the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of juſt men
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169957:59"/> made perfect, whoſe capacities are greater then ours; if there be enough in God for <hi>Angels,</hi> whoſe capacities are greater then theirs; if there be enough in God for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe capacity is yet far wider; if there be enough in God for <hi>God himſelf;</hi> then there muſt needs be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a man: If he can ſay, that God is his God, he needs no more, this will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and fill his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This Propriety is that which will <hi>hold out.</hi> All our intereſt in men and things is very <hi>fleeting,</hi> experience ſhews it; the Anchor comes home again, becauſe the ground was not firm: All friends are but like flowers in the hand, they are mine now, anon they are good for nothing, and are no bodies. You have this given as a reaſon, why we ſhould not truſt in Princes, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. <hi>Becauſe they paſs away, and their thoughts periſh:</hi> What ever they intended and had contrived for your good, all dye with them. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that found favor in <hi>Egypt</hi> for <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſake, ſuffered when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Pharaoh</hi> aroſe that knew not <hi>Joſeph.</hi> But if our friends live, nothing is more common then to have an eclipſe and a damp brought upon the love of friends. But Chriſt loves to the end; and if he loved his people when he was in this world,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169957:59"/> how much more doth his love continue now he is in the other world? Becauſe here his love met with many difficulties, but there he hath nothing hard to do; his work lies plain and eaſie before him. The affections of men are ſubject to a natural, I may call it an unnatural, mutability, which is not only a torment to others, but to themſelves; for that man that changeth his heart, ſuffers as well as he from whom his heart is changed: and this is help'd on by many things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By offences that ripen and quicken that fickle mutability of this poor, frail, mortal, changeable creature, Man; You ſhall have him <hi>now</hi> like the Sun in his <hi>full ſhining,</hi> and <hi>anon</hi> ſome cloud of offence <hi>darkens</hi> all his love: We were the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt creatures that could be, if God ſhould be ſo to us; but he hath expreſſed himſelf in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. that he will <hi>abundantly pardon,</hi> and that he will <hi>multiply pardons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Diſtance many times takes off the edg of love and friendſhip among friends, friends oftentimes dye one to another while they live: The child ſometimes is forgotten of his Father, and the wife of her husband: But the eye of God is ever upon us, and we cannot but be ſatisfied in his love, whoſe eye is ever fixt upon us; as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169957:60"/> you have his promiſe in the laſt of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Lo I am with you always to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a love that is faſtened only by a ſhort relation, as between the Maſter and the ſervant, and thoſe that are in a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood for a time; when the term of years is out, that relation ceaſeth: But it is not ſo between Chriſt and the Saints.</p>
               <p>In the fifth place. This Propriety that the people of God have in him is moſt <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,</hi> becauſe there is neither want of love nor power in God. In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.14. <hi>All ye aſſemble your ſelves and hear; which among them hath declared theſe things? the Lord hath loved him; he will do his pleaſure on Babylon, and his arm ſhall be on the Caldeans.</hi> Whether we underſtand it of his love to his people, or of his love to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it is not much material as to the ſetting forth the efficacy of this Propriety. If we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of his love to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who perhaps was yet a ſtranger to God, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, he would do ſo great things, as he had ſpoken, for him; how much more effectual will his love be to thoſe to whom he is engaged by relation? He will ſtick at nothing, becauſe his love is ſo great; no offences ſhall hinder, becauſe he hath engaged to pardon: You are ſure to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169957:60"/> ſpeed when you come to God; they that ſee this their Propriety in him, therefore muſt needs rejoyce.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, This Propriety in God is not <hi>onerous</hi> and <hi>burdenſom.</hi> Indeed our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to men, and our propriety in them, is oftentimes <hi>coſtly;</hi> and not without <hi>charge</hi> can we either preſerve or act our friendſhip toward them: We uſually loſe by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; A man accepts a benefit, and loſeth his liberty, as a wiſe Heathen once ſaid. A man by his engagement is put oftentimes upon hard ſervices; he is made to do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, that receives every thing; the more you take from a friend, the more he is diſcharged, and he things he owes you the leſs, and that you owe him the more: But indeed whatſoever God doth, is an engagement upon him to do more for you. Expreſſions of friendſhip from friends come many times mingled with much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, harſhneſs, and rigidneſs; But when God diſchargeth the part of a Father and a Friend, he doth it like himſelf, it comes pure, like water out of a pure fountain, no ſadneſs, no bitterneſs mingled with it; He doth it with all his heart; as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41. <hi>I'le rejoyce over them to do them good, and with my whole Heart, and with my whole Soul.</hi> Oh when kindneſs comes ſo, it comes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169957:61"/> ſweetly! What refreſhing is it then to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in all their conditions to look upon divine Love, that's ſweet, and clear, and pure? All theſe joyn'd together make but one head of Arguments from that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that is in God.</p>

            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Saints engaged to live upon God by the Law of Nature, Love, and Judgment. Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Relation is mutual. True Reſignation hath Conſcience with Love. A divine Power <hi>in</hi> and <hi>over</hi> Saints. The grace and peace of Saints furthered as they mind their Intereſt in God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANother Argument is this, We have nothing elſe to live upon; we muſt either live here, or no where: If we live not upon what we have in God, we are dead men, for God is our life. The life of every creature is maintain'd proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by a threefold Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some by the <hi>Law of Nature:</hi> ſo fiſhes live not but in the water, and beaſts in their paſtures, and cannot live in the Sea: And indeed there is ſomething of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine new nature in Chriſtians; they muſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169957:61"/> live in God, or they dye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>Law of Love:</hi> The child loves the mother above all women, though it may be there be many better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord hath placed the life of the child in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: how much more the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in himſelf? for there is no love like that love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Life is cut out by the <hi>Law of Reaſon and Judgment,</hi> by which men chuſe their portion, upon which they feed, and upon which they make their lives. This way no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God is eligible to a good man; He ſaith, ſome other things ſerve for other uſes, but not to live on. Nothing but God can be made our own, nothing out of God is properly our own, but our ſins: How can a man ſay that is his own, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command and hold? Nothing can be made full enough, ſtrong enough, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our deſires, but God: Hence it is that a good man lives in God, becauſe he can live no where elſe; Though he make uſe of his bed to ſleep on, of his meat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him, and do as others do in the uſe of theſe things, yet he would be a very dead man, worſe then a man layd in the grave, if his life were not in God.</p>
               <p>I would exhort you then, <label type="milestone">

                  <note place="margin">Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortat.</note> that you would thus live in God; it is a riddle to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169957:62"/> the world, but a truth to Saints, and that which their Souls can witneſs to: The world knows no other life then friends, eſtate, and ſuch like enjoyments; the Saints know that there is no life in theſe; they live another life which the world knows not of. Live this life, that is, make this to be the ſtrength, reaſon and rule of all your walkings, to be the pillar and prop of your Souls, whereon you may lean and reſt; make this your ultimate reſt, that after all the troubleſom turnings and toſſings of this world you may take reſt here, in this peace of God which paſſeth all undereſtanding, that you may ſay as <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. He <hi>was in trouble; but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I truſted in the Lord, and ſaid, O Lord, thou art my God;</hi> and this was all to him againſt all trouble: <hi>They ſeek my life, and make me a deriſion; but I ſaid, O Lord, thou art my God.</hi> Two things I premiſe in this Exhortation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you make your Intereſt in God ſure, that you may be able to ſay without fear and trembling, <hi>thou art my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Intereſt is mutual; if God be yours, then you are his; He is yours by gift of himſelf to you, and you are his by gift of your ſelves to him: Remember the day when, how, and by what act you did give your ſelves to God: Have you put
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169957:62"/> by your ſelves, and all your ſinful propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, diſpoſitions, and reſolutions? Have you layd an abſolute denyal upon them, never more to obſerve them, much leſs to ſerve them? And have you reſolved that you will have no purpoſes or deſires but ſuch as are according to God? Be ſure if you cannot ſay you are his, you cannot ſay he is yours: You may pleaſe your ſelves indeed with fancies, and vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of that which is not; but know this, that ſuch a kind of Contract with God as we ſpeak of, hath evidence in it; It's not a cold and liveleſs acting, but there is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and efficacy in it. Theſe two things will be of power in that man that hath in truth given himſelf to God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſcience with Love; Conſcience without Love hath very much power in it, but Conſcience with Love is very potent: Indeed Conſcience will tell thee, O man, thou haſt given thy ſelf to God, therefore thou ſhouldſt walk as his: And Love will take thee aſide, and ſound the ſame alarum in thine ears too, but more effectually.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing is the power of God <hi>in them</hi> and <hi>over them;</hi> There is a power of God <hi>in</hi> ſuch: <hi>You have received,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the ſpirit of power,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. This is the difference between the relation
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169957:63"/> that is between God and his people, and all other relations: This relation conveys the Spirit of God into men. The husband and wife that are never ſo cloſely knit, cannot convey their ſpirits one to another; the husband may wiſh that his wife were wiſe and meek, but he cannot give her ſuch a ſpirit: But the relation between God and his people always works a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit; the Spirit of God is given to them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, There is a power of God <hi>over ſuch,</hi> becauſe he ſees that there is a great power againſt them: They <hi>are kept by the power of God through faith unto Salvation.</hi> Certainly if you have not ſuch a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence joyned with Love, and find not ſuch a power of God watching over you, and the Spirit of God guiding you, you are none of his.</p>
               <p>Another thing to be premiſed is this, That a Chriſtians life, whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the life of peace, or the life of holineſs, depends much upon his minding of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God. The Apoſtle in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. tells them, they had loſt much of the life of Chriſtianity; how came that? becauſe they <hi>had forgotten the Exhortation that ſpake to them as unto Children.</hi> And in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Who forſakes the guide of her youth, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169957:63"/> forgets the Covenant of her God.</hi> The latter is the cauſe of the former; becauſe ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the Covenant of her God, therefore ſhe forſakes the guide of her youth.</p>
               <p>You have need to ſeek much in God; your ſins are many, your dangers great, you know it well enough: You have this encouragement, Whatſoever you go for, you knock at the right door; whatſoever you ask, you ask that which is as much your own, as any thing you enjoy: God hath made over himſelf to you, in becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yours; He hath ſaid he <hi>will be your God:</hi> All particular promiſes are but ſtreams from this Spring, and branches from this Root. Your Intereſt is larger then Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are nothing to God: Therefore if God be yours, you have more cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, then if he had made you actual and ſole Poſſeſſors of Heaven and Earth. In the world they that have little of their own, comfort themſelves that they have ſomething in their friends; ſuch a Lord, ſuch a Duke is their friend: So if you have not much in this world, comfort your ſelves in this, that God is your God. The Lord thought this enough to comfort his people with, when they were afflicted and toſſed with tempeſts: He that takes not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169957:64"/> comfort in this, either knows not what God is, or denies what he profeſſeth to know. <hi>Live by Faith;</hi> or as ſome render theſe words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Feed on Faith.</hi> When you come to God, you come not to ask a title, but to plead a title; you come not to ask any thing that was not your own before, but you come to ask the poſſeſſion of it. You cannot ask more then he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give you: He takes more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in giving (I do not ſay then you can take in asking, though that be much, but) then you can have in enjoying. The Propriety you have in God is by a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; ſo that he by whoſe means you come by this Propriety, hath all things put into his hand, and he is in ſtead of God to you; as it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he was <hi>in ſtead of God</hi> to his Brethren. He that hath obliged us to be whatſoever we can to thoſe that are ours, hath much more obliged himſelf to be all that he can for us. Chriſt was made ſo great, not for his own ſake, but for our ſakes; if he be ſet on the Throne, it is for our ſakes: What ſhall we need to fear, when we come to ask any thing of him? He ſtands more obliged to us, then we can be to ours; becauſe it is eaſier for him to do what his place calls upon him for, then it is for us; for the engagement is ſtrongeſt,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169957:64"/> where the performance is eaſieſt; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are dearer to him, then ours are to us; the deareſt child is not ſo dear to its mother, as we are dear to him: and the hurt that would come to thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, if he ſhould fail them, is greater then can come to children by the neglect of their parents. Again, The honor that Chriſt hath engaged is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite more concernment: If a father be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, that is a ſtain upon him; but what is a ſpot of diſhonor upon a piece of dirt? But if the Prince of Glory ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, this would highly reflect diſhonor upon him. How may we walk with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ſecurity, and account our ſelves richer then Princes, and ſtronger then Armies? Though all this, nothing concerns thoſe that ſtand out, and are as ſtrangers and aliens, that will call God Father whether he will or no, that are not taught it from above, but have learned it of themſelves. If a man cannot call God his Father and his God upon good grounds, what a miſerable ſtate is that man in? He is nothing, he hath nothing, and there is nothing between him and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery, but a moment of time: He goes up and down pleaſing himſelf with vain ſhews, pleaſing himſelf with painted
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169957:65"/> Butterflies; but hath nothing to live on, he is utterly unprovided for Eternity.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2d</label> IF the ſight of our Intereſt in God be the life of Saints, then let thoſe who plead an Intereſt in God walk worthy of it: It is precious, for it is their life; it is worth all that is required of you: That which God calls for at your hands, takes nothing from your happineſs, but adds much to it. It is the Apoſtle's exhortation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing.</hi> Let me propound to your Conſiderations a few things, to put you on to this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, You are deeply obliged to pleaſe God, and thereby to walk worthy of him; for being in ſo near relation to him, you have not only the <hi>portion,</hi> but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of children: <hi>Becauſe you are ſons, therefore he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169957:65"/> hath ſent the Spirit of Adoption into your hearts, Gal.</hi> 4. Other relations,<note place="margin">This was touched in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> becauſe they want ſtrength, are not always beautified and ſweetened with a convenient ſpirit: The relation of a husband cannot commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a meek ſpirit to his wife, nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a parent to the child, becauſe of their impotency; their will is ſtrong, but their hand is ſhort: But God in that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous relation wherin he ſtands unto his own, gives them a Spirit like unto himſelf, that ſo he may have Children anſwerable to himſelf and to his Will: In <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> He that is <hi>joyned to the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7. <hi>is one Spirit.</hi> As perſons conjoyned in marriage are <hi>one fleſh,</hi> ſo he that is married to the Lord, that is brought into that near relation unto him, is <hi>one Spirit;</hi> they are one in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, propenſions, diſpoſitions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. As we ſay of a multitude, they are of one heart and of one ſpirit when they conſpire in one: ſo God and his people are one Spirit, becauſe they center in one; he in governing them, and they in ſubjection and ſubordination to him, ſo one, as things ruled and the Rule is one. This argument the Apoſtle urgeth in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of Fear, but of Power,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169957:66"/> Love, and of a Sound Mind.</hi> He had in the words before exhorted to this, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I put thee in remembrance, that thou ſtir up the gift of God that is in thee, by the putting on of my hands:</hi> But <hi>Timothy</hi> might ſay, How can I do that? Why, ſaith the Apoſtle, we have received not the ſpirit of <hi>fear,</hi> but of <hi>power.</hi> It is a time of danger indeed, and a hard work to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in ſuch days as theſe; but he that is gifted and fitted by Chriſt to that work, hath received a ſpirit of <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> by which he is able to mannage the things that he hath received of God.</p>
               <p>Then I ſay, having received the Spirit of children, the obligation lyes the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon you to walk as children. This is a Rule; The more proportionably a man hath received ſtrength and ability to his work, the more he is bound to it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more of the Spirit you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the more you are obliged. And this Spirit of Chriſt in his people acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its primitive original Pattern; as it wrought in Chriſt, ſo it will work in you according to your proportion. This moving will be ſtrong, becauſe it moves upon the higheſt grounds, that which is moſt taking and prevailing; it moves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hopes and ſenſe of eternal life. If you
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169957:66"/> walk not ſo as to pleaſe God, you walk with much frowardneſs of heart, and your ſin is the greater. It's true, though you have received this Spirit, yet there is much of the ſpirit of this world in your hearts; but this is our duty and our work, not to ſuffer the better Spirit to be quel'd and damp'd by the other.</p>
               <p>But yet again, that you may ſee it more fully, remember, if you pleaſe not God, you act againſt your own Intereſt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, for your life is bound up in the favor of God; when you therefore act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, you act againſt your ſelves. The Apoſtle uſeth ſuch an argument in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. where he exhorts husbands to <hi>love their wives, for no man ever hated his own fleſh:</hi> He means this, that they being one, the husband cannot ceaſe to love his wife, but he loſeth ſo much of his own life, becauſe they are one; therefore croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and untowardneſs between them ſtrikes them dead.</p>
               <p>In unequal relations the inferior is more dependant, and ſo ſhould be more ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate: In the relation between the father and the child, the child is the lower part, and lives more upon the father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to live more according to the Father, according to his Will, or elſe he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169957:67"/> acts againſt himſelf, he offends his father to his own hurt: And the goodneſs of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors is of greater influence and force, then that of Inferiors: Take a child in the goodneſs of a child, be it never ſo high, that cannot work ſo much to the good of the father, as the goodneſs of the father doth for the child.</p>
               <p>The love, goodneſs and mercy of God, who is infinitely greater then we, is of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable influence to our good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be tendered and preſerved. Sin in the nature of it is a violation of the Law, that is, of the Will of God; the effect of ſin is a provocation of wrath and anger: Hence it is that the Wiſe-man ſpeaks ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>He that ſins againſt me, wrongs his own Soul:</hi> He offers violence, he ſpoils his own Soul, he becomes a robber of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The nature of ſin aims at the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that againſt which it is ſet, although it do not attain this effect, becauſe of the power of him againſt whom it is; for it's a denying of all that God is, as that he is infinitely wiſe, infinitely good, &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. that <hi>profeſs they know God, but in works they deny him;</hi> how is that? that is, by their works they declare that they do not acknowledg him as he is. Men therefore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169957:67"/> that ſeek not to pleaſe God, do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as if men in a Ship ſhould with Axes, or ſuch like Inſtruments, ſeek to cut holes in the Ship wherein their lives lie. To act therefore againſt God, is to act moſt deſperately againſt our own good; and by this we ſee how we are engaged to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>Again, take this in, that God will more eaſily be pleaſed with his people then with others, therefore they are the more bound: He takes that well from ſome hands, that will not paſs from others: It is true, we are all under one Law and Rule, God did not deſtroy the Law by taking his people into a Goſpel ſtate, but eſtabliſhed it; nay, the Law binds more then it did before, only as the binding power of it is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo the rigor of it is abated, that is, the terms of obedience required are changed: God ſaid before, If you do not this and this, and every thing to the height of it, you ſhall dye: but he doth not hold his people to thoſe terms now that we are reconciled to him; all is due that is commanded: but he accepts of what we can perform; ſo that here is the difference: The Law ſpeaks to one ſort, to thoſe that are in the fleſh, that are out of Chriſt, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169957:68"/> written in the Law to do them.</hi> To the other ſort, whom God accepts in Chriſt, he ſpeaks as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>He accepts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what a man hath, if there be a willing mind.</hi> Now if leſs will paſs with God, and be well taken from thine hand then from others, thy ſin is greater then others, if thou doſt it not.</p>
               <p>Further, You are engaged much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have had taſtes of the ſweetneſs of walking with God. This is that which made that aggravation of their ſin, which God hath ſaid he will not forgive; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. That <hi>they had taſted of the powers of the world to come:</hi> But it's a greater engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have a taſte of God himſelf, then to have a taſte of the things of God; to have a taſte of that excellency and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in him, is far a greater bond then to taſte of all his favors.</p>
               <p>Nay, you have had a taſte of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wandering from God, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; witneſs the blows and ſtripes of your own ſpirits, and the frowns of God upon you: How hath your unwary walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led you into a wilderneſs of darkneſs and fears? and will you yet ſin thus againſt God? Have you not ſaid in thoſe diſmal days, as in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I'le return to my firſt husband, for then it was better with me then
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169957:68"/> now?</hi> And have you given your ſelves to God again and again, and do you now neglect him? Will you not endevor to fulfil your promiſes? Mark how God carried himſelf to his people that neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Of old time I broke thy yoke, and burſt thy bonds, and thou ſaidſt, I will not tranſgreſs;</hi> thou ſaidſt thou wouldſt not, but thou didſt; for <hi>under every green tree, and upon every high hill thou wandereſt, playing the harlot: Yet I planted thee a noble vine; How then art thou turned into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate plant, of a ſtrange vine unto me?</hi> It is a dangerous thing to break promiſe with God; he will plead your own words againſt you. That then is one main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, why ſuch as plead an Intereſt in God ſhould labor to walk in all pleaſing to him, from that Engagement that lies upon ſuch to God.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Conſideration is this, Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you will weaken the comfort of your hope and expectation in prayer. How can you rationally, with any ſatisfaction to your own ſpirits, expect that God ſhould fulful your will, that are not willing to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his? How diſ-ingenious and baſe is it for a man to wiſh in his heart, that God would act ſo as to pleaſe him, when in the mean time he is not careful to pleaſe God?
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169957:69"/> It doth horribly impoſe upon God, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a moſt vile and baſe ſpirit; it impoſes upon Gods Wiſdom, upon his Goodneſs, and indeed upon all that God is: and God takes it very ill to be thus dealt with; as he expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11. <hi>The heads thereof judg for reward, and the Prieſts teach for hire, and the Prophets divine for mony; yet they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.</hi> What followed? <hi>Therefore Zion for your ſakes ſhall be plowed like a field.</hi> God will not be ſo put off. This ſin borders upon that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.20. <hi>If any man ſay, I ſhall have peace, though I walk after the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mine own heart; my wrath and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and I will ſtrike out his name from under Heaven.</hi> You come to me, ſaith God, and ſay, O Father, ariſe and ſave us, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. but you do all the evil againſt me that you can; or, as ſome read it, you do evil, and you can; or, and you prevail: that is, Whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I told you how ready I was to do you all good, you have now ſo tempted me and provoked me with your ſins, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with me to reſolve to give you over. This ſin was that which bred in <hi>David</hi> ſuch diſcouragement to come to God, that he had rather ſtay till <hi>his bones waxed old
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169957:69"/> through roaring,</hi> then go to God; this is that <hi>guile</hi> of heart, which he ſpeaks of in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2, 3. Againſt this it was that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> reaſoned with the people in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. That after all their former evils they ſhould not depart from God. Take heed therefore of ſuch a ſtate, leſt you fall into thoſe evils that the Conſcience of unholy walking will bring you into.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="3">3. A Third Conſideration is, the Nature of your Intereſt in God: I'le ſet it before you in a few Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is one that is above you, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and higher then you are. Now the Law in unequal relations is this, That he which is of the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> ſide, be a <hi>relief;</hi> that he that is of the <hi>weaker</hi> ſide, be <hi>ſubject;</hi> if therefore you walk not in obedience, you do what in you lies to deſtroy your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, to make God not to be yours: for in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. ſaith God, <hi>If I be a Father, where
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169957:70"/> my fear? If I be a Maſter, where is my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I cannot reckon my ſelf a Father to you that do not fear me, nor a Lord to you that do not honor me; therefore if I be a Father, and if I be a Lord to you, where is my fear? and where is my honor? And upon this reaſon he ſpeaks to them in the firſt of <hi>Hoſea, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammi, you are no more my people.</hi> This is the utmoſt miſery the Creature is capable of, to be in a ſtate of ſeparation from God. <hi>Wo to them,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>in the day when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them,</hi> in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. Indeed all woes lie in that woe, as all evils lie in that evil of departing from God. Of other relations ſome are natural; but that relation between God and us, is of will, from grace; we <hi>are</hi> his now, we <hi>were</hi> not; but he hath choſen us, called us, renewed us, and adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. In relations the better ſide hath often need of the weaker; Kings need their Subjects, and cannot be without them: But God had no need of us; he is ſo far above us, that he doth not ſtand in need of us, or any thing in the whole Creation. <hi>My goodneſs extends not to thee, O God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>It's an happineſs to have an Intereſt in one greater then our ſelves; an Intereſt in a Begger is of no worth, becauſe he is of no
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169957:70"/> power; but Intereſt in a Prince all men ſeek: Therefore in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. it's ſaid, <hi>Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are the people whoſe God is the Lord; and bleſſed are the people whom he hath choſen for his own inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as our Relation is thus to one above us, ſo our Intereſt is the beſt and neareſt that can be in God. God was free to let out his love to every thing as he pleaſed; all Creatures have an Intereſt in him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch who have been expelled and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated. In a <hi>Kingdom</hi> every Subject hath an Intereſt in the Prince; but thoſe of his <hi>family,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of his <hi>blood,</hi> his <hi>children,</hi> have the beſt Intereſt in him. The Intereſt that the people of God have in him, is the higheſt, and the neareſt, the nobleſt Intereſt, that ſuch Creatures are capable of: In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. <hi>ult.</hi> They are a <hi>people near unto him: Near,</hi> not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>employment,</hi> but in reſpect of <hi>affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> they are in God. They are called a <hi>peculiar</hi> people, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. So in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.15. Though <hi>all the Earth be mine, yet you are my Treaſure.</hi> We might have had the Intereſt of <hi>ſervants,</hi> and truly that had been much for us; we had reaſon to ſay as the Prodigal, <hi>We are not worthy to be called thy Sons, make us as thine Hired Servants:</hi> But now he hath ſet us ſo near to himſelf,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169957:71"/> as we could not be nearer; this ſhould much oblige us to him.</p>
               <p>Again, It is a renewed Intereſt: The Propriety we had in God was loſt; but as he ſaid in mercy concerning <hi>Jeruſalem, Zech.</hi> 2.12. <hi>I have choſen Jeruſalem again,</hi> ſo he hath ſaid concerning us, <hi>I have choſen them again,</hi> and taken them in the <hi>ſecond time. We were afar off,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>but now we are made nigh.</hi> That may be ſaid of us, which the father ſpoke of his prodigal child, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24. <hi>This my ſon was dead, but he is alive; he was loſt, but is found.</hi> Our ſtate of righteouſneſs is by <hi>regeneration,</hi> by <hi>renovation</hi> and <hi>reception;</hi> we <hi>were</hi> cut off, but we <hi>are</hi> planted again into the Tree of Life: Therefore now to neglect God, is the greater ſin. In <hi>Judg.</hi> 4. it is ſaid, That after God delivered them from the yoke of the Ammonites and the Moabites, <hi>they ſinned again;</hi> and that is ſet down as an aggravation of their ſin. And for us, after pardon, and after reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after reception into grace and favor, not to pleaſe God, is a ſin of an higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then the ſin of the world.</p>
               <p>Further, Concerning the nature of our Relation to God, look upon the Cauſe of it; it is by Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>We are made near in him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169957:71"/> and that by a ſtrange way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God contrives an Attonement to be made by Chriſt for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then God contrives a Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and us, that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with him, and ſo become one with the Father. And upon this Reaſon Chriſt ſpake thoſe words in <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>Now I aſcend to my Father, and to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to my God, and your God.</hi> Not to take care to pleaſe, is a token of one afar off: It's a mark of thoſe wretched ones men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15. that <hi>they pleaſe not God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take but this in too, <hi>viz.</hi> the Effects of this Intereſt; All your former ſins are done away, and all good is become yours: <hi>All things are yours,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> Whatſoever you ask is yours: In <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Whatſoever you ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my Name, I'le do it.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>God content to be ours, though we had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned him, and depraved our ſelves. Gods Intereſt in us chargeable to him. God owns not all, but ſome. Peculiar frowns upon thoſe which walk unworthy of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth Conſideration is this, The Nature of Gods Intereſt in us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's an Intereſt that hath ſuffered vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence: There was a great violation made, and much diſhonor caſt upon it; for God was rejected and caſt off by us. In the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Apoſtacy, the whole nature of Man caſt him off quickly, and upon a ſmall temptation; and ſince that every one of us in our own perſons have often caſt him off, and denyed him when he hath pleaded his own right, and have ſaid, he ſhould not bear rule over us: This might have ſet him againſt us, and the rather, becauſe our offence was not acknowledged by us, we bore it away ſtifly: God found us in this ſtate, <hi>We were enemies in our minds by evil works;</hi> or, <hi>by our minds on evil works,</hi> Col. 1.21. <hi>If a woman depart from her husband, and be married to another, will he receive her again?</hi> ſaith God in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. Yet he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169957:72"/> us, though we have offered violence to that Intereſt which he had in us upon all accounts. The Angels did thus indeed, but God never pardoned them, when he reached forth his hand to the loſt World, 2 <hi>Heb.</hi> 16. <hi>He did not take hold of them, he took hold of man,</hi> to bring him unto repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſo to bring him back again to his firſt Eſtate. If the greater force the leſſer, the leſſer is pitied; if the leſſer force the greater, every one wonders at him, and condemns him. Oh what condemnation is this worthy of, that the Creature ſhould force the Creator! and deny God that made him to be his God! And yet this we have all done.</p>
               <p>Again, It's an Intereſt that hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed detriment and loſs: We are not what we were, when we were firſt his. At firſt we were a glorious ſtructure, as we came out of his hands: But ſince we gave our ſelves to other Lords, there is nothing but darkneſs and confuſion, and what ever is vile and unlovely in us. <hi>You are degenerated,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>into a ſtrange vine unto me,</hi> Jer. 2.20. <hi>[Strange,]</hi> that is, not only new, or what it was not; but <hi>[ſtrange,]</hi> that is, one that I <hi>know not,</hi> that I <hi>approve not:</hi> as we uſe to ſay when we are offended with one, You are a <hi>ſtrange man;</hi> that is, not
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169957:73"/> according to mine <hi>expectation</hi> or <hi>deſire.</hi> So we were gone into a condition <hi>ſtrange</hi> to God, yet he hath taken us in again. If a ſervant run from his Maſter, and when he is become poor, blind, lame, deformed, and altogether diſeaſed, ſhall find re-admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; what an act of grace is this? This is our caſe; we went from God when we were well, and are become altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, deformed, and in an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety unto God. The Father took in the Prodigal when he had ſpent all; he gave him indeed a goodly portion, but he miſ-ſpent it, and miſ-ſpent himſelf; yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him again as a Son: So God hath dealt with us; therefore this ſhould be an engagement upon us to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>Again, It is an Intereſt with <hi>charge:</hi> The Prodigal when he returned had nothing to live on, but muſt live on his Fathers <hi>alms:</hi> When God took us in again we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we muſt wholly live upon him.</p>
               <p>Again, It is an Intereſt by <hi>free choyce:</hi> God takes in not <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>ſome;</hi> and what mercy is it that any of us ſhould be of that <hi>ſome,</hi> if any of us ſhould make any of that <hi>few</hi> which God hath reſtored to favor?</p>
               <p>One Conſideration more is this, that <hi>God will have it ſo:</hi> If God be your God, he calls for this, that you be careful to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169957:73"/> pleaſe him; he will make you to do it. It is a moſt abſurd thing to dream of ſuch a ſtate of grace, that gives licentiouſneſs, to walk in ſinful inordinate affections contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God: it's againſt the Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power of God; and he having Power in his hand will never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it.</p>
               <p>Three things God will do to thoſe that pleaſe him not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He will <hi>ſuſpend the ſweetneſs of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> which you have expreſſed in the words of that good Prophet, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.2. <hi>He went out to meet Aſa, and ſaid unto him, Now hear thou me, and all Judah and Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, The Lord is with you, while you are with him; and if you ſeek him, he will be found of you; but if you forſake him, he will forſake you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond thing is a <hi>denyal of ſucceſs</hi> to you: What you hope for, ſhall be blaſted; what you deſire, ſhall be broken; that which you fear, ſhall come upon you. Thus God dealt with this King <hi>Aſa;</hi> becauſe to ſhun War he ſwerved from God, and took a wrong courſe, <hi>therefore,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>thou haſt done very fooliſhly; henceforth thou ſhalt have War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third thing is, that he <hi>will deny ſuch the teſtimony of his favor;</hi> for want of which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169957:74"/> 
                  <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. ſo complains, looking upon himſelf as a man ſpiritleſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Abſolute Neceſsity of Intereſt in God. God is either with or againſt his Creatures. Whoſoever hath not God, hath no true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in any thing.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat which I ſhall next ſpeak to in a few words, is this; That every one would look after the getting of an Intereſt in God: And then that you would clear up this Intereſt to your own Souls, that you may be able to ſay, <hi>My God will hear me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Labor for an Intereſt in God: Nothing is more <hi>neceſſary:</hi> for it is not here as it is in other caſes; if you cannot have one man to be your friend, you may be without him; though he will not be <hi>for</hi> you, he will not be <hi>againſt</hi> you: God ſtands not <hi>neuter</hi> in any ſtate of indifferency towards his Creatures, either he is with them, or againſt them; and to have God againſt us, is the greateſt evil that can be. Two ways this will vex and torment the ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:169957:74"/>1. In reſpect of the ſight of the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> that God is: If that be hid from our eyes now, know that a day of <hi>Revelation</hi> is coming, when God ſhall ſhew forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Glory, and then he will appear to be what he is, when there is no more hope left for the enjoyment of him. Do not turn that into the greateſt miſery, which in its own nature is the moſt attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive worth, the moſt refreſhing comfort and true happineſs, that is, God. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God in Heaven makes that life, that high life, that eternal life: It muſt needs therefore be death, the worſt of death, all death, to have him againſt us.</p>
               <p>But it is not only the Contemplation of his Nature, the ſight of what he is, that ſhall afflict; but his <hi>Power</hi> ſhall be <hi>viſibly</hi> put forth againſt ſuch as have neglected him; and he will act againſt thoſe that did not act toward him, and ſeek to get an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him: Where he ſaith not, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> he will ſay, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this, Remember that <hi>we are made for this end,</hi> to have an Intereſt in God, and converſe with him; we were <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>originally</hi> deſigned to this; now if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not our end, we are loſt. We many times make things for ſuch ends as they do
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169957:75"/> not reach; but if they cannot ſerve one end, they may ſerve for another: but if you attain not this end, you attain nothing, you are loſt. When God made thee firſt, he made thee in a capacity for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf; that capacity remains, but nothing can fill it up but himſelf: So that the ſpirits of men ſhall roar and weary themſelves to Eternity in reſtleſs motion after that which they cannot attain. It is true; as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> when he was gone from his <hi>fathers houſe</hi> made a ſhift to live on <hi>husks</hi> and ſuch <hi>traſh</hi> for a time, ſo do many now; but the day will come, when God will take theſe <hi>husks</hi> away from you, wives, children, pleaſures and eſtates, and what ever it is that gives you ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment in this world; and then you will be left worſe then nothing, you ſhall neither have God nor the world.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſuch a neceſſity there is to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, that you have indeed no <hi>true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> in any thing till you get a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Intereſt in God, though you think you have: That man that hath not God, hath nothing; it is moſt ſure; for he is under ſentence: A condemned man loſeth all his eſtate. Men will perſwade themſelves they are Lords, and that <hi>they have this,</hi> and <hi>they have that;</hi> but <hi>indeed</hi> they have <hi>nothing:</hi> what they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169957:75"/> have, is but <hi>priſoners allowance;</hi> ſomething is allowed to condemned men till the ſtroke comes: and this is the caſe of all men that have not God for their God.</p>
               <p>Know alſo, that a man is not ſaid to have any intereſt in any thing that doth not <hi>add ſomething to him,</hi> if it be not ſomething that contributes to his well-being. A man doth not reckon his ſickneſs, diſeaſes, pains, and ſuch evils and miſeries to be his; intereſt in theſe things no man accounts of, it is unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: Whatſoever adds not to a man, ſtands for a <hi>cypher,</hi> is nothing: Intereſt in nothing, is nothing. That which we claim Intereſt in, muſt have ſome good in it to give out unto us. But now the real good of a man is no way promoted by any thing, while he lives without God in the world. It is the priviledg of Saints, that <hi>all things work together for their good, Rom.</hi> 8.28. And it's as true otherwiſe, that nothing works for the good of thoſe that love not God. Children and eſtate may tend to the goodneſs of one mans condition; there may be <hi>good</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of them to <hi>one</hi> man, and yet may prove to the <hi>hurt</hi> of <hi>another;</hi> as the beſt good may be evil to this or that man: to a man that is under the Curſe, all turns to bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and death. The truth is, that which kills life, doth leſs hurt the ſenſes then that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169957:76"/> which only deſtroys the peace and reſt of a man. A man feels more by a ſtroke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, then he doth by a Conſumption or an Apoplexy. That which deſtroys moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, is oftentimes leaſt felt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what men feel not, becauſe of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enjoyments, they conſider not, they lay not to heart: But if God be your God, then <hi>all is yours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Then comes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt <hi>in all.</hi> As he that marries the heir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Lord of the eſtate; ſervants, and cattel, and lands are his, he commands all the family: So if God be our God, the whole Creation becomes ours. Men come to have much by coming to God: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gives ſome account of this in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. where he ſaith, <hi>We are come to Mount Zion, to the City of the living God, to an innumerable company of Angels, to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, &amp;c.</hi> We come to all theſe, to communion with theſe, when God becomes ours. We begin therefore at the <hi>wrong end,</hi> when we ſeek any thing in this world, and ſeek not God <hi>firſt;</hi> for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and all theſe things ſhall be given to you.</hi> When therefore you ſeek eſtates, and the accommodations of this life, and do not indeed ſeek to make God yours, you act very croſly to your own good.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:169957:76"/>
               <p>There is a <hi>ſimple neceſsity</hi> to look after this; for beſides what hath been ſaid, you all live and are in a ſtate of <hi>abſolute depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon</hi> God, who hath the power of life and death: we are all in his hands; and that <hi>Key</hi> by which he ſhuts, and none can open, you ſhall ſee put forth one day, when you ſhall know what a loſs it is to miſs an Intereſt in him, who hath all power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth. That's one thing which ſhould make us ſerious to get an Intereſt in God, that it's ſimply neceſſary.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A Second Argument is, That it is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt <hi>moſt attainable;</hi> for it is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fulneſs by which we come to have Intereſt in any thing; theſe are the Springs of all Communication between one and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and where theſe are greateſt, there is a wider door opened, a fuller, eaſier and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169957:77"/> ſweeter entrance into Communion, and the enjoyment of each other. It's the nature of <hi>goodneſs</hi> to be <hi>communicative;</hi> and the more <hi>goodneſs,</hi> the more ready to <hi>communicate.</hi> Look through the whole Creation, and you ſhall find it ſo, that as any Creature is more noble and excellent, ſo it is the more hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and bountiful, the more ready to give out it ſelf. The <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral are they? Things of a more confin'd and ſtraitened nature, are but like a ſmall Cottage, into which one or two, or a few may enter; but it cannot give habitation to many: But as Creatures abound in the goodneſs of God and his fulneſs, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like a ſtately Palace, that gives open, ready, and liberal entertainment to many. Now God is greateſt in all Excellencies, and therefore his Propenſions to Mercy and Goodneſs towards his Creatures are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably, unconceiveably greater, then any Propenſions in the Creature can be.</p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>two Glories</hi> God infinitely tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends all Creatures, in the glory of <hi>his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the glory of <hi>his Working.</hi> Nothing more ſets out God and exalts him, then his readineſs to do good, and communicate himſelf to his Creatures. He hath ſaid, <hi>It's a more bleſſed thing to give then to receive.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it's ſometimes a more bleſſed thing to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169957:77"/> 
                  <hi>give,</hi> then to <hi>have</hi> and <hi>enjoy.</hi> Take one that hath great power to do good, and no love, what is he but like a meer <hi>Iron Cheſt,</hi> a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſealed?</hi> Now God is moſt ready to do good; it's his glory. It's ſaid in <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.23. That <hi>the deſire of a man is his kindneſs. [The deſire of a man,]</hi> that is, that <hi>which is moſt to be deſired,</hi> the moſt precious thing in a man, that thing which makes him deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that renders him glorious and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is <hi>his kindneſs;</hi> that he is a kind man: ſuch an one wears a Crown and Garland up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head. This Crown God wears above all; the <hi>deſire of God is his kindneſs.</hi> And to make it yet more apparent, that an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God is moſt attainable, Conſider,</p>
               <p>That by which we come to have an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in another, is uſually the <hi>manifeſtation of our deſire,</hi> with the tender of <hi>our love and affections to him;</hi> and this is beſt done, and with moſt efficacy, with God: for the breathings and operations of a mans ſpirit lie more open to him, then to any creature. One may wiſh good-will to another, and may want skill to make his mind known; but you cannot have an ingenuous and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wiſh in your Souls, <hi>O that God were my God!</hi> but he hears it, and knows it; He hears ſpirits, and reads ſpirits, as we do words. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.9. <hi>My groanings are not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169957:78"/> hid from Thee.</hi> If thou loveſt God, and thine heart be towards him, he needs no Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Spokes-man to tell him what thine heart is. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He knows the meaning of the ſpirit:</hi> When it can but <hi>ſob</hi> and <hi>ſigh</hi> within it ſelf, <hi>O that God were my God!</hi> he knows the meaning of that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. When Chriſt asked <hi>Peter, Loveſt thou me? Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Add to this, That there cannot be that aſſurance of ſpeeding upon the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſpirits to any, as there is with God. I may make my mind known to another for the enjoyment of his friendſhip, yet I may fail and come ſhort of it: but now if I come to God with an ingenuous and ſincere deſire to have God to be my God, I ſhall not fail in that. You ſeek many things in vain; but God never fruſtrates his poor people in their deſires after him; He croſſeth them in many of their <hi>other</hi> deſires, but never in <hi>that:</hi> If he be ſo good that he ſatisfies the deſire of all things, of every living creature, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. much more will he ſatisfie deſires after himſelf; for theſe are from his beſt love, they ſpring from his own boſom, and he'l be ſure to bleſs them, they ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their end.</p>
               <p>Other deſires may be ſatisfied with other
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169957:78"/> things; if you cannot have one thing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing may ſerve you in its ſtead; if a man cannot have this friend, he may have another: But we muſt either have Gods love and his friendſhip, or we dye for ever. He hath engaged himſelf, that thoſe that thirſt after him, ſhall never go without him; the word ſtands upon record, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſpake it from his Father, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for they ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. And <hi>let him that thirſteth come,</hi> in <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe deſires are given not only to be as a byaſs or principle of motion in our Souls after God, but are planted in our Souls as indubitable pledges of his love, and of his habitation there. Other things are firſt deſired, and then obtained; but God is firſt ours, before he be deſired. Divine love works downward, it begins in Heaven; and that Communion that is wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, begins in himſelf and from himſelf: He <hi>loves</hi> firſt, and <hi>ſpeaks</hi> firſt; and our love is but the <hi>anſwer</hi> of his love: If we can ſay to God, <hi>Lord, I am thine,</hi> this is but the <hi>eccho</hi> of what he hath ſaid firſt, <hi>I am thine.</hi> So in <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. latter end, <hi>I will ſay</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>Thou art my people, and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my Father.</hi> Oh, this aſſurance of obtaining mercy with God for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169957:79"/> poor thirſty Creatures, it is the honey and milk of our Souls, our greateſt joy, and the ſatisfaction of our ſpirits in this life. They that ſeek God, ſhall glorifie him: If they ſeek once, the next thing is praiſe; their hearts ſhall live for ever. The manifeſtation of this grace, mercy and goodneſs that is in God, is the life of ſuch as ſeek him. In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.15, 16. <hi>What ſhall I ſay? he hath ſpoken to me, and himſelf hath done it; I ſhall walk ſoftly all my years in the bitterneſs of my Soul. O Lord, by theſe things men live, and in all theſe things is the life of my ſpirit; ſo wilt Thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover me, and make me to live.</hi> He ſpeaks of Gods goodneſs appearing to him, in that act which was not a <hi>ſingle,</hi> but a <hi>compound</hi> act; and it was not a meer natural good, but a ſpiritual and inward communication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it took him much; What ſhall I ſay? <hi>I ſhall be at reſt,</hi> as one quieted and ſatisfied in ſpirit, after my bitterneſs: I have had ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but now I have ſeen the love of God towards me, I rejoyce: I was tumultuous before, and unquiet, and unſatisfied; but now I ſhall be ſatisfied. Hitherto you have been looking upon the feaſibleneſs of this Intereſt, that no Intereſt is ſo attainable as Intereſt in God. And if you will look once more, conſider how many bars there are to our Intereſts with men, and you ſhall ſee
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169957:79"/> how theſe things that are ſuch impediments with us, are of no force with God. Many times a <hi>poor man,</hi> a <hi>begger,</hi> one <hi>in rags,</hi> knows it would be his happineſs to have an Intereſt in ſuch a Prince; but how ſhall he come at it? In <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The poor man is hated of his neighbor;</hi> he is afraid, if he ſhould ask ſomething of him, he ſhould burden him: Nay he is hated of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and though he ſpeak with intreaties, yet he is anſwered roughly; <hi>What, thou a Begger, and come ſo boldly to ask of me?</hi> And yet we that are but poor beggers, and in our rags, may have free acceſs to God. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.7. it is ſaid, <hi>All the brethren of the poor do hate him; how much more will his friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part far from him?</hi> But God turns not back our prayers; though we be poor and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to call us Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strangers</hi> have a bar in their way: Come to a great one, <hi>I know you not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I never ſaw you before; what have you to do to come to me?</hi> Therefore <hi>Ruth</hi> was much taken with the kindneſs of <hi>Boaz,</hi> becauſe ſhe was a ſtranger to him. What are we but ſtrangers and aliens, afar off? and yet he rejects us not when we come near him. God will not ſay to men, <hi>I know you not,</hi> though they have been ſtrangers, except when they come too
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169957:80"/> late. In <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many (I ſay unto you) ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhall not be able;</hi> that is, they ſeek too late. <hi>When once the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut the door;</hi> if then you come and ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> he will ſay, <hi>I know you not.</hi> But ſeek him while the door is open, while he may be found, and he will be ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Impotent</hi> perſons that are fit for nothing, how ſhall they get an Intereſt in great ones? <hi>What can he do?</hi> ſay they, though it be but for a ſervants place. What would become of us, if God ſhould put that queſtion to us? He receives us when we are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, fit for us: Nay when we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then he was reconciled to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Now then you ſee that God hath received ſuch perſons; indeed be never receives any other: So that upon all accompts an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God is more attainable, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intereſt. That's a ſecond Argument: I'le name one more.</p>
               <p>Intereſt in God is <hi>better enjoyed</hi> then any other Intereſt whatſoever. There is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to be enjoyed with that ſweetneſs, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, uſefulneſs and conſolation, as our Intereſt in God is. For beſides that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and infinite Fulneſs that is in God,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169957:80"/> know that this Intereſt is not ſubject to any diſſolution. Intereſt in God <hi>now,</hi> is better then it was in our <hi>firſt</hi> eſtate, when we came out of Gods hand. All other Intereſts may ceaſe: If our love, or others lovelineſs ceaſe, our Intereſt is gone; and the loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every Creature under the Sun will have an end, but God abides. Take a man, the moſt wiſe, the moſt learned, the moſt amiable, the richeſt man, all theſe things will paſs away: but our Intereſt in God is not ſubject to any ſeparation, that is, we ſhall be never from him. The abſence of our friends is like the ſetting of the Sun; they are life to us in their preſence, but when they are gone from us, they cannot help us, they are ſo far dead to us: but God is ever with us.</p>
               <p>Intereſts with men are oft-times very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting: A man muſt do this, and do that, and much ado to pleaſe. Men do tye up their Intereſt ſo ſtrait, that except things be done at this time, and after this mode, we indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a flaw. God doth not impoſe upon his people after this manner.</p>
               <p>And again, Other Intereſts are apt to be tyred, and ſo fall into a dull ſleep of mutual forgetfulneſs, becauſe the goodneſs that is in us is but little; a ſhallow Ciſtern is ſoon drawn dry. But with God there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at all to give out love; and if he ſpend
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169957:81"/> himſelf never ſo much this way, he is not at all diminiſhed; <hi>He reſts in his love, Zeph.</hi> 3. His joy and ſelf-contentment is always flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. So that as this Intereſt is more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, ſo it's better to be enjoyed.</p>

                  <p>Chriſtians ought to clear their hopes from Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties. Beleevers doubt through their own fault. They that ſeek God, muſt purſue their end.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat which follows next is Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That you would not only ſeek this Intereſt and get it, but that you would ſeek to know it, and to be ſatisfied that you have indeed an Intereſt in God. Live not upon hopes mingled with uncertainties and anxieties: Let not this ſuffice, <hi>It may be God is my God,</hi> or <hi>I hope he is;</hi> but <hi>put it out of doubt. Give all diligence</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Sure,</hi> as firm ground, that you may ſo know it, that there may be no trembling of heart about it, that it may be a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion made up in your own ſpirits, that you are the called and choſen of God. <hi>For if you do theſe things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169957:81"/> ſhall never fall, but an abundant entrance ſhall be adminiſtred to you into his Kingdom:</hi> You ſhall never <hi>fall;</hi> or as it is ſometimes ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, you ſhall never <hi>offend:</hi> So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 2.10. <hi>He that Offends in one, is guilty of all.</hi> Indeed the ſight of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God carries a man with more even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrength in his way, and keeps him in more compliance with, and conformity unto God. Sometimes the word is rendered <hi>[ſtumble;] Rom.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Have they ſtumbled, that they ſhould fall?</hi> If a man know God to be his God, he walks with a more even and ſteady foot, all his ways are more plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, mountains of difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will be layd level, there will be nothing to daſh his foot againſt, to hinder him in his race; and an entrance in abundance will be adminiſtred to him into the Kingdom of Heaven: Fears and doubts ſtraiten our way, and hinder our paſſage to the Kingdom of God. Suppoſe a man were to go into an houſe where he fears he ſhall not enter, this would very much hinder his endevor: But when a man ſhall have a bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect into Heaven, and ſee his place there, that muſt needs further his more abundant and free entrance into it. But more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that I may perſwade you (if God will) to be very ſerious in this thing, to make
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169957:82"/> your Intereſt in God more certain, let me tell you,</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, That no man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves in <hi>Chriſt</hi> wants it, but through his <hi>own fault;</hi> I ſay, it is a mans <hi>own fault,</hi> if he be not able to ſay that <hi>God is his God.</hi> I ſpeak now according to the ordinary courſe of God demeaning himſelf to his people. There is nothing of greater concernment, either to his peoples welfare, or the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own deſign which he hath upon them, then the manifeſtation of his Love, and the ſatisfaction of their ſpirits, in that great Queſtion, Whether God be their God. And that Spirit, upon whom lies the Office of <hi>bringing</hi> from <hi>darkneſs</hi> to <hi>light,</hi> hath this Office alſo, of <hi>refreſhing</hi> and <hi>reviving</hi> the ſpirit, and therefore bears that name, the <hi>Comforter:</hi> He not only eſpouſes us to Chriſt, but maintains a perpetual entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is his work: He is not only the bond of our Union, but the light of it, by which we ſee our ſelves one with Chriſt, and ſo one with the Father. Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, they find not God to be their God; but it is not becauſe God is not willing to ſhew himſelf what he is, but becauſe they are wanting to themſelves. There are two great faults that oftentimes wrong us, and keep us in the dark, and make that ſeem a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169957:82"/> ſecret, which otherwiſe might lie open to our eyes.</p>
               <p>One Error concerneth ſeeking:<note place="margin">Some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God to the queſtion.</note> Some ſeek not at all, and never put the queſtion, whether God be their God, but run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, live and dye venturing their Souls to Eternity. Others complain, they ſeek, but they cannot find; fain they would be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this thing, but they cannot: Now I ſay, the complaint muſt fall upon our ſelves, there is perhaps a fault in our ſeeking. This is the word that muſt ſtand faſt for ever, <hi>God will be found of them that ſeek him:</hi> In <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.13. <hi>Then you ſhall find me when you ſeek me with all your heart.</hi> To ſeek with all the heart, is not only to ſeek <hi>truly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,</hi> (ſome ſeek but in <hi>words</hi> only, making <hi>verbal</hi> prayers without any <hi>inward ſenſe,</hi>) but to ſeek him <hi>ſtrongly</hi> above all things; and not only from an <hi>ardent thirſt</hi> of ſpirit, but to ſeek him <hi>without ceaſing,</hi> till we find him. <hi>In due time we ſhall reap, if we faint not, Gal.</hi> 6. The Rule of Scripture you know is this, that we <hi>pray inceſſantly,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. Mark that in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. <hi>After two days will he revive us, and in the third he will raiſe us up; Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is prepared as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he ſhall come unto us as the rain; as the former and latter rain unto the Earth.</hi> If
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169957:83"/> you follow on, if you follow the buſineſs, you ſhall obtain: God hath <hi>appointed his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth as the morning;</hi> that is, as the Sun riſeth and fails not, as the Sun goes forth in its light, and grows; ſo will Gods appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his people be: And as the rain comes upon the thirſty Earth, and cauſeth all things to ſpring afreſh; ſo ſhall the manifeſtation of Gods love be to thoſe that ſeek him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing. What if God appear not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and you have not that full anſwer to your deſires? Though he come ſlowly, yet he will be ſure to come; his ſtaying is not a denyal; and his not ſhewing himſelf, is not an hiding himſelf; He is uncovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and making way for the appearance of that which you would fain have a ſight of; He ſtays a while, to make his love the more viſible afterward; by his abſence he raiſeth the mind, and enlargeth the heart, to deſire and long after his preſence; and then his manifeſtation will be fulleſt. God is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nay more ready to open, then you are to knock; he loves that thirſt in you, which is after himſelf; he loves to be loved: let him be pleaſed as well as you. It may be ſeeking Chriſtians are not ſo ingenuous as they ſhould be: We are not to <hi>ſeek</hi> him only, but to <hi>pleaſe</hi> him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.2. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep his Teſtimonies, and that ſeek him with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169957:83"/> their whole heart:</hi> That ſeek him, and his Love, and keep his Law. Or it may be offences have been, but not bewailed: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency is the continuation of ſin; You are ever doing that evil which you have not been humbled for; nothing nulls it but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and humbling your ſelves in the ſight of God. With what face can you ſay to God, <hi>Let thy love, O Lord, be upon me,</hi> when as you cannot ſay to God, <hi>Lord, I love thee?</hi> That man cannot ſay he loves God, that deſires not to pleaſe him. Can he ſay his heart is with God, who ſuffers his heart to go out after other things? Why ſhould he deſire ſo to impoſe upon God, that God ſhould love him, whom he deſires not to love and pleaſe? it is unreaſonable. What father would be ſo dealt with, that the child walking in ſtubborn courſes would have his father ſhew nothing but clearneſs of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and love to him? <hi>David,</hi> all the while he was under clouds of guilt and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, wiſhed that God would ſhew forth the light of his countenance to him; but he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many wrackings in his Soul till he confeſſed his ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. What God hath ſaid, he will have fulfilled. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but not one tittle of his Promiſe.</hi> If he hear not, it is not becauſe he is not a God hearing prayer, but becauſe you
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169957:84"/> hear not him. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.19. <hi>I ſaid not unto the ſeed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the Lord ſpeak righteouſneſs, I declare things that are right:</hi> I ſpeak as I mean, my words and my heart agree in one. What ever our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences have been, if we be ingenuous in our approaches to God, God will not look upon our offences, but upon our perſons: In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. you have this promiſe, <hi>If my people that are called by my Name ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their ſin, and will heal their Land.</hi> If thy Soul be ſick, and thou mourneſt after God that hideth himſelf from thee, and humbleſt thy ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteſt of thy ſins with abaſedneſs of ſpirit before him, he will hear.</p>

                  <p>God hath fully made known whom he loves. Chriſtians able to know themſelves. Gods Spirit ſtrengthens the teſtimony of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Chriſtians hindered by Slothfulneſs and Diſcouragements.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Second Fault is, That God doth give the manifeſtation of his Love, and we
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169957:84"/> receive it not; we accept it not. I will, for the more full clearing of this, lay down theſe Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That God hath given to his people <hi>ſufficient means</hi> for the knowledg of their Intereſt in him; for he hath told us who they are that he loves, whom he hath choſen and called out of this world, and made his peculiar people. If he had carried on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of love to particular perſons in his own breſt, no man could have known who was loved of him, then we had been left in the dark; for <hi>no man knows the things of a man, but the ſpirit of a man,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. But as the Angel <hi>marked</hi> thoſe in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that were to be <hi>ſpared,</hi> ſo there is a <hi>mark</hi> that God hath ſet upon his own, by which they may be known to what <hi>fold</hi> and <hi>flock</hi> they do belong. And indeed the end of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo diſcovering and ſetting forth the <hi>marks</hi> of the people of God, is for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we may know our Happineſs. So in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. this was the end of writing his Epiſtle; <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have I written unto you that beleeve on the Name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may beleeve on the Name of the Son of God.</hi> Wherefore was it that he had told them how many ways they might know that God dwelt in them
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169957:85"/> and they in God? Wherefore did he make ſo many deſcriptions of thoſe whom God had ſet his love upon? but <hi>that you may know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that you have eternal life,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are ſuch.</p>
               <p>And he hath not only done thus, but hath given us underſtanding alſo, by which we are able to know not only other things, but our ſelves; by which we may judg our ſelves, and our actions, and what is within us. Neither hath he given us an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meerly natural, but it is raiſed, being il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with his own light, that we may be able to find out the work of God in us; an underſtanding that can reflect upon it ſelf, not only in way of ſimple viſion and apprehenſion of what is within us, but by way of argumentation and reaſoning: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3, 5. <hi>Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments: And whoſo keepeth his Word, in him verily is the love of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; hereby we know that we are in him.</hi> God hath given us underſtanding to reflect upon our ſelves in a way of reaſoning, to make certain to our ſelves our Intereſt in theſe things. Nay he hath given us <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that bears witneſs to our ſpirits that we are the ſons of God,</hi> Rom. 8. We muſt not think that was a ſpecial favor given to the Saints then, but it's common to all the people of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169957:85"/> God. The Spirit of Adoption hath a double office, of <hi>quickening</hi> and <hi>comforting;</hi> and whoſoever is a ſon, hath the teſtimony of that Spirit.</p>
               <p>There is a double Teſtimony: A Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>things themſelves;</hi> ſo that which is of God in us doth bear witneſs; as the <hi>effect</hi> bears witneſs of the <hi>cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's another Teſtimony, and that is of <hi>God himſelf by his Spirit;</hi> and that Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doth help our ſpirits; it helps the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the things themſelves, and clears them; it leaves them without doubt; it ſtrengthens and fixeth faſt the Soul in the knowledg of its Intereſt in God.</p>
               <p>God ſtands obliged for this unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for their <hi>comfort</hi> lies in it, and that makes to the fulfilling of his laſt <hi>end,</hi> which is his glory; for how ſhall we give him praiſe, if we know not that God is ours?</p>
               <p>Beſides, he hath given us viſible Seals to ratifie all the Promiſes to us: He hath given the earneſt of his Spirit to his; He hath ſet Chriſt on the Throne for us, an indubitable Pawn of his Love; and many other, which are ſtill with us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond Conſideration is this, That the people of God in the want of this knowledg and aſſurance do not what they may, they do not improve that ability and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169957:86"/> thoſe means which God hath put into their hands; and ſo they ſpin out their days in heavineſs, mourning and anxiety. Either there is <hi>ſlothfulneſs</hi> of ſpirit, or ſome <hi>diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> of ſpirit upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Slothfulneſs,</hi> and ſo they are <hi>careleſs, idle and vain;</hi> having loſt the ſweetneſs of the enjoyment of God, their hearts are poured out upon vanities; they have gone a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after other things, and have placed their Souls upon things that will not profit, and are not induſtrious to ſeek after God. When the Soul is thus gone out from God, then it commits folly under every green tree; there's no plant that may yield any kind of refreſhing, but they will ſuck ſomething from it: Whileſt the Soul is buſied about other Intereſts, and ſecuring them, the other great buſineſs lies by.</p>
               <p>Another ſort are under <hi>diſcouragement;</hi> they ſay, The work is hard, it's a very hard thing to find out this matter, to do that whereby it ſhould be found. Saith another, I have endevored and ſought and done all I can, and cannot compaſs it.</p>
               <p>Conſider, you that ſay it is hard; what a <hi>vain</hi> thing is it for a man to plead, that a thing is difficult which muſt be done? Will you plead difficulty againſt neceſſity? You muſt do it, or your life will be as death; you
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169957:86"/> will loſe the comfort of all Promiſes, of all Performances; the Promiſes will be as a ſealed Fountain, that you cannot drink of them.</p>
               <p>But again, It is <hi>falſe</hi> to ſay it is hard: That falſe Prophet within us communicates of his own ſpirit to us, and we oftentimes ſpeak untruths againſt God. Is it hard to walk in the way of life? Is it hard to enquire after God? Is it eaſie to be hunting after the world, and getting ſomething in this life? Is it hard to reach after the fruit of the Tree of Life? When you ſeek after God, you are in that very way of Life, wherein they now are, that ſhall enjoy God to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Diſcouragement</hi> is this; I have endevored, but it is a fruitleſs thing; I ſee I ſhall never be ſatisfied. <hi>Poor Soul!</hi> Wilt thou indulge that remiſſneſs of ſpirit that is in thee, to a contradiction againſt the God of Truth? He hath ſaid, If thou ſeek him, thou ſhalt find him; He hath ſaid he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the mourners; He hath ſpoken as much as can be deſired: What would you have God to do more? Rather blame your ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then your ſucceſs: Say not, It is in vain to ſeek, becauſe I have not found; nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, Becauſe I have not found, therefore I muſt ſeek more and ſeek better. What
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169957:87"/> ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. If any man love me,</hi> be he what he will be; though he hath been a notorious wretch, though he hath been a grief and burden to me, and offended me <hi>days without number;</hi> yet <hi>if he love me, my Father will love him, and we will come and make our abode with him.</hi> Will you rather blame the truth of the Promiſe, then your ſelves? The fault muſt be layd on us: <hi>Let God be true, and every man a lyar.</hi> It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that we do not what we might do, in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We do not <hi>call</hi> our minds in, and <hi>bend</hi> them to this work of enquiring after God, and ſetling this great queſtion of our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God for ever. And indeed if we do not call in and <hi>bend</hi> our minds, and uſe ſome enforcements upon them, they will never do their work: There is upon our minds anatural fluidneſs and dulneſs; they go out eaſily to all things but unto God. The mind muſt be <hi>ſummoned, preſt, bound</hi> and <hi>buckled</hi> to this work: Saith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>This ſecond Epiſtle, Beloved, I now write unto you, to ſtir up your pure minds: [To ſtir up your pure minds;]</hi> The Apoſtle was afraid of them, leſt dulneſs and ſluggiſhneſs ſhould
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169957:87"/> fall upon their minds: If you do not ſtir up your ſelves to the work, and gird up the loyns of your minds, the work will not be done.</p>
               <p>Another fault is, That as men do not bend their minds to the work, ſo they do not <hi>hold</hi> them in a way of beleeving and cheerful expectation of what they ſeek for: Saith the Church in <hi>Micah</hi> 7.9. <hi>I will bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Lord until he plead my cauſe:</hi> So long as I ſeek the Lord, I will wait and expect that he will hear me, and anſwer my deſires. In <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Sow to your ſelves in righteouſneſs, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to ſeek the Lord, till he come and rain righteouſneſs upon you.</hi> You muſt ſeek the Lord till he come. In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 62.7. This is the counſel of God by his Prophet, That you <hi>give him no reſt until he eſtabliſh, and till he make Jeruſalem a praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, There may be this fault, We do not bring things to an effectual judgment. Many queries are raiſed about this buſineſs, but there is not a full hearing and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; but either the Court breaks up before things are concluded, and ſo the Soul is left to hang upon a poor thred of a feeble hope, I hope God is my God; or elſe the Soul is contented to bear the burden
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169957:88"/> of many fears and ſorrows, not ſtirring up it ſelf as it ought to get free of them. So that doubtleſs it's our fault that we have not ſo clear a knowledg of our Intereſt in God, as to make us to triumph or glory therein. One way or other we are defective; either in our ſeeking of God, or in our not receiving what God gives unto us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third Conſideration is, That we have often offended and ſinned againſt the Spirit; and then God weakens his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony towards us, and doth not ſo make himſelf known to us as we deſire. <hi>David</hi> by his ſin brought himſelf into that ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he knew not what to make of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as appears by that prayer of his in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. He lookt on himſelf almoſt as one in bonds, eſtranged from God, a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpirit. In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.2. ſaith God, <hi>Your ſins have ſeparated between me and you.</hi> Certainly God leaves us very frequently, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the manifeſtation of his love is very needful. In <hi>Micah</hi> 3.4. the time was an evil time, and ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Then ſhall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them; he will even hide his face from them at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth Conſideration is, That we do not ſeldom or not a little reject the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God, and oppoſe the light and the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169957:88"/> clear manifeſtations of his Love to us. The Comforter comes many times; but that may be ſaid of us, that he ſaid of himſelf in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>My Soul refuſed to be comforted;</hi> would not be comforted. As againſt the <hi>conviction</hi> of the Spirit in wicked men there is a great deal of conteſt, a great fight, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.34. <hi>Alſo in thy skirts is found the blood of the Soul of poor Innocents; I have not found it by ſecret ſearch, but upon all theſe: Yet thou ſayſt, Becauſe I am innocent, ſurely his anger ſhall turn from me:</hi> I ſay, as wicked men riſe up in oppoſition to the conviction of the Spirit; ſo good men likewiſe have their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions againſt the <hi>conſolations and comforts</hi> of the Spirit; not only againſt the <hi>counſel</hi> of it, but againſt the comfort of it. In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.13. you have an inſtance of this, ſee how ſweetly God ſpeaks, <hi>Behold, theſe ſhall come from far: Sing, O Heavens, and be joyful, O Earth, and break forth into ſinging, O Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; for God hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</hi> But what ſaith the Church? <hi>But Sion ſaith, The Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me.</hi> What ever God ſaid, yet ſhe ſaid God had forſaken and forgotten her. A like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you have in <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.45. There are ſtrong holds in our ſpirits againſt the inward comforts, as there are againſt other opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169957:89"/> of the Spirit; and it requires the mighty power and operation of God to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle our hearts in peace, as well as to convince us of our miſeries and dangers. The work of Converſion is quickly done, becauſe it is of greateſt concernment; I'le give it you in this ſimile. A mother finds her child among devouring Hogs or Dogs, or what you will; ſhe makes haſte to ſnatch her child out of danger, but he is all bemoiled and dirted, and his clothes; ſhe makes not ſo much haſte to get him clean, and to put other clothes upon him. So God quickly finiſheth the work of Converſion and Regeneration; he makes haſte to free us from danger and miſery; but he makes not ſuch ſpeed to comfort us, and to eſtabliſh our hearts in the aſſurance of our Intereſt in him; that may be done at leaſure.</p>
               <p>As there is a <hi>reluctancy</hi> in us againſt the <hi>work</hi> of grace, ſo there's a <hi>reluctancy</hi> againſt the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of grace; we are apt to turn all that God ſpeaks and doth for us againſt our ſelves; the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>dejection</hi> is moſt natural to us, conſidering the ſtate of our <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and what we are judged to. A <hi>ſlave</hi> doth naturally <hi>torment</hi> himſelf with <hi>fears,</hi> and with ſad expectations. It's eaſier to us to believe the ſentence of <hi>condemnation,</hi> then of <hi>Juſtification:</hi> Sin is more viſible
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169957:89"/> then Grace. The greatneſs of the things promiſed are ſuch, that they make the Soul at a ſtand: To have pardon of ſin, to be adopted, to be raiſed from the depth of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to ſuch a ſtate of bleſſedneſs, this makes the Soul to be like thoſe that dream: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is a concurrence of forreign power to heighten all this.</p>

            <div n="11" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Encouragements to endevor the clearing of our Intereſt in God. Love cannot hide it ſelf. Love will not deny what may be eaſily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is much needed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Second Argument is taken from the <hi>encouragement</hi> we have to put us on, to put this out of queſtion, that God is ours: Certainly there is more eaſe in this then we are willing to beleeve. I ſpeak it to the glory of God, and our ſhame, That the things which God hath ſpoken and done for our encouragement ſhould be ſo great and high, and yet we ſhould lie ſo low in the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſpirits about this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider, whatſoever excellency there is in any love, that is in Gods love tranſcendently. Love is very fruitful, it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169957:90"/> brings forth much for thoſe towards whom it is ſet; it will not be hid; it is compared to fire, which is known by its heat; and you ſhall know the warmth of love where it is. A man may uſe the words of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 27.16. which he ſpeaks concerning the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward woman, <hi>Whoſo hideth her, hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand which bewrayeth it ſelf:</hi> That as the wind cannot be concealed when it is up, and as a ſweet ointment cannot be concealed, but it will diſcover it ſelf; ſo wrath and love (for there is the like reaſon for both) they cannot be hid. A friend is contented not to have his <hi>beneficence</hi> known, he would do much more then his friend ſhould know of; but he would have his <hi>benevolence,</hi> his love and good-will, known and manifeſted: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8, 10. ſaith, He obtained this grace to <hi>ſhew forth among the Gentiles the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</hi> Near relations live upon the manifeſtation of love; thoſe which are more remote need leſs, and leſs is due to them. The child will have but an ill life, unleſs he have the light of his fathers countenance: The husband and wife will have their life imbittered, if there be not mutual love. As life is viſible, ſo is love; it will diſcover it ſelf, and the higheſt love will moſt diſcover it ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:169957:90"/>
               <p>A ſecond Encouragement is, That what may be eaſily done, may be eaſily obtained of a friend. What is more eaſie with God, then to make us know that he is our God? It is but one beam of light from Heaven that doth it, but a word ſpoken; <hi>Soul, be of good comfort, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Love ſtands not at ſmall matters, eſpecially great Love: The Love of God is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pattern of Love, and the moſt glorious Spring of Love; all Love flows from it: Therefore if the love of a creature can do ſo much, how much more will the Love of God do? If your child ſhould beg of you to give him a good look, could you deny him? would not your love conſtrain you? And ſhal not the Love of God much more? Certainly it is more for him to love you, then to tell you he loves you: He hath put forth his love already in a ſtrange way, to give his Son for you; and do you think he will be ſo unwilling to ſpeak a word of peace to his people where it is duly ſought?</p>
               <p>Again, where a thing is moſt needed, where one ſtands in much need of what a friend can do for one, that will be ſoon granted. What do you need more then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of ſpirit in the ſenſe of the Love of God? All the fears and tremblings of the hearts of his people are for want of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169957:91"/> light of his face. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a ſtrange child, found her bowels and compaſſions moved within her. Do you think Gods compaſſions are not richer and fuller to his own? A child ſometimes may complain (but it's not to the honor of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) My life is uncomfortable, becauſe my father loves me not, ſhews not his love to me; though perhaps there be cauſe for it: And there is cauſe that God ſhould deal ſo with us; but he hath ſaid he will not: If we turn from the evil of our ways and repent, he will multiply pardons, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p>Again, A thing that may be eaſily done, will not be denyed when it's <hi>asked;</hi> when it's not only what we need, but what we beg: This Chriſt ſhews in the Parable of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judg. Importunity</hi> will move a <hi>ſtone;</hi> how much more will the affectionate <hi>tears</hi> of an ingenuous <hi>child</hi> move the compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate heart of a <hi>tender father?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third Encouragement is, That this is <hi>ſimply neceſſary</hi> to the right <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of our Relation, and to the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of the <hi>priviledges</hi> of it. What is thy relation to God, but of a child to his Father? What Law lies upon a child but to <hi>obey?</hi> and that not as a ſlave, but with a filial ſpirit. How can you be cheerful in your work, when you have this cloud upon your ſpirits, this pang
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169957:91"/> upon your Souls, I know not whether God be my God?</p>
               <p>Again, The <hi>Law</hi> of a child is to live a life of cheerful <hi>dependance</hi> upon his father: But how can a man live thus upon God, when he doubts whether God be his or no? How can I be confident to receive great things of a ſtranger, much leſs of an Enemy? But God appears in theſe forms to me, ſo far as he appears not to be my God.</p>
               <p>Again, This Law lies upon a child, to live with <hi>cheerfulneſs of heart</hi> upon his <hi>fathers fulneſs.</hi> This the Scripture calls for; We are to rejoyce, and rejoyce evermore; and with all joy, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.11. and in the worſt times: <hi>Account it all joy when you fall into divers temptations,</hi> Jam. 1.2.</p>
               <p>I'le add but this, That thoſe deſires that are after God, after the knowledg and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his being our God, are from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; God hath planted them in us, and God hath invited, called and ſet us a longing and a thirſting after him: And will he tell us of a Fountain of Life, and not let us drink of it? Will he call us to himſelf, and when we come to him, will he hide himſelf? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we are very much miſtaken, when we go to God to beg this grace, to have our Souls refreſhed with the ſight of his Love, if we go ingenuouſly, with a cheerful reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169957:92"/> of our ſelves to him, if we go not with a cheerful expectation, that God will hear our prayer.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>They are not right who are careleſs to clear their Evidence. Wiſdom and Love make the Saints ſeek after full ſatisfaction. Two ſorts of Content in the want of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Third Argument is this; If you ſeek not, and that induſtriouſly and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, to put this Queſtion out of queſtion, you are not right. It's an Evidence againſt a mans ſincerity, and his real fellowſhip with that inviſible world, when he is not careful to know what Intereſt he hath in it. The Saints deſire nothing more, with them there is nothing above the Love of God that they ſeek, and nothing beneath it that they can reſt in. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and there is none in all the world that I deſire in compariſon of Thee,</hi> Pſal. 73. <hi>David</hi> had whatſoever the heart of man could deſire in this world, he had all ſorts of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and contentments, and yet he was ſtill athirſt till he could come to the Well-head and drink of the Water of Life; He was
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169957:92"/> painfully athirſt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. There are two great <hi>Springs</hi> of theſe <hi>deſires</hi> and <hi>tendencies</hi> of Soul after God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that repreſents God as he is, in that amiableneſs and glory which takes them; it repreſents him in goodneſs and greatneſs, as one in whoſe hands all things are: ſo that nothing is concluded to be of that concernment with them, as to have God to be their God: <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in Thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Love:</hi> The Saints have their hearts knit to God; there is nothing which they ſo much prize as him, they are taken with him above all things, therefore cannot be content without him; their deſires after him are infinite, till his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs fills up their whole capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and leave no more place for hope; till he hath bleſſed them with the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf. You know, Reaſon in things of importance will not be eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. While we are in any doubt, we have no reſt. Men muſt have things cleared to them that are of weight; and much more ſhould they in this, which is the greateſt of all. They ſay, and cannot but ſay, as <hi>David</hi> doth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.17. though his own ſpirit often told him that God was his God, yet
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169957:93"/> he looks up to Heaven, and ſaith, <hi>Shew me a token for good.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.3. <hi>Cauſe thy face to ſhine upon us, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The ſhining of Gods face puts a man into a ſtate above men, and Devils, and all things.</p>
               <p>Love is both <hi>eager</hi> in the <hi>proſecution</hi> of its <hi>end,</hi> and very <hi>curious</hi> in its <hi>judgment.</hi> It is <hi>eager</hi> in the <hi>proſecution</hi> of its <hi>end,</hi> it will not be eaſily put off; it finds out its Object, and knows it, and will not take a ſhadow for the thing: if it be not ſatisfied, it rouls reſtleſly, and ſinks and dyes in it ſelf; like <hi>Noah's Dove,</hi> that fluttered up and down the world, but found no reſt for the ſole of her foot. It is death to the man that loves God, not to ſee that God loves him. They therefore are not right, they are not Believers in earneſt, there is not a through work upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that can dally with God and be at reſt, when they are not clear in this, that God is their God. There be two very great Evils in this thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſuch a man lives in <hi>contempt</hi> of God: This is contempt to be content to be without God. That which I know not to be mine, I am without: That which I know not to be mine, is as if it were not; if I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therefore to live ſo, that I know not God to be my God, I am content to be without God.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:169957:93"/>
               <p>There is a <hi>contentment</hi> that is oppoſed to <hi>murmuration,</hi> to froward perturbation of mind and fretting; this muſt not be: no not in the midſt of clouds and darkneſs, and in the depth of our diſputes about this great thing, Whether God be my God, and my ſins pardoned, and whether my Soul ſhall be ſaved: And in caſe I be not ſatisfied in the thing, there muſt be a patient waiting for Jeſus Chriſt, and the glory of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; though we be <hi>mournful,</hi> yet we muſt be <hi>patient, quiet</hi> and <hi>humble:</hi> As in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. <hi>In the way of thy Judgments, O Lord, we have waited for thee; and the deſire of our Souls are unto thy Name, and the remembrance of Thee: With my Soul have I deſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> And in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I will wait upon the Lord that hides his face from the houſe of Jacob, and I will look for him</hi> [or, <hi>I will ſtay for him] till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another kind of <hi>contentment</hi> of <hi>dulneſs</hi> and <hi>ſtupidity,</hi> from darkneſs, which over-clouds the Soul, and bears it down. Now I would argue thus; The <hi>doubts</hi> thou findeſt in thy ſpirit, are either <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>ſtrong;</hi> if they be not great, but ſome little anxieties, they are more eaſily overcome, and thy fault is the greater that thou ſuffereſt thoſe clouds to remain, which thou mayſt ſo eaſily
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169957:94"/> ſcatter: when the queſtion is not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, when there is not much againſt it, thou art the more negligent that thou doſt not draw it to a full determination. It is with many Chriſtians, as it is with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Army in a Nation, that hath beaten down all Forces round about them, only there is a weak party now and then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who cannot do much; but when the <hi>Militia</hi> in a Commonwealth hath beaten down the Enemy before them, it cannot ſtand with their faithfulneſs to ſuffer the leaſt party to remain in oppoſition to them: No more can it ſtand with our faithfulneſs with God, and our own Souls, to ſuffer the leaſt party of doubts to continue, but to make all clear and ſure. We will not ſuffer the leaſt flaw in a Leaſe, or any ſecurity for the things of this world.</p>
               <p>I grant, that we are like to live in diſputes all our days. There's no <hi>vacation</hi> with a Chriſtian, but always <hi>Term</hi> time; ſtill ſuits, ſtrifes and contentions: But you muſt ſtrive to hold your own; you muſt be employed to quench all the fiery darts of Satan. As a man that is in poſſeſſion of an Eſtate, when one comes and lays claim to one part of it, and another comes and challenges another part, and ſo a third, and a fourth, he keeps his Suit a foot againſt them all, and ſo holds
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169957:94"/> his own: So muſt we go on conquering, till we have ſubdued all fears and doubts that riſe within us. Satan is a <hi>cunning Sophiſter,</hi> as full of <hi>ſubtilty</hi> as he is of <hi>malice;</hi> if he cannot draw men to groſs <hi>prophaneneſs,</hi> he will tempt them to <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubtings.</hi> Now as <hi>holineſs</hi> works againſt <hi>ſinfulneſs,</hi> ſo it ſtrives againſt doubts. <hi>Doubting</hi> is as truly a ſin in a Believer, as any other miſcarriage: A good man cannot reſt till he ſee all well. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.11. <hi>By this I know that thou loveſt me, &amp;c.</hi> If he cannot lay hold on ſomething to draw this concluſion, he thinks himſelf a moſt miſerable man.</p>
               <p>Again, Suppoſe thy doubts <hi>be ſtrong,</hi> that thou canſt not make out this, that God is thy God; if thou canſt notwithſtanding ſit down, and make a life of ſweetneſs and contentment in other things, thou contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt God; this ſhews you care not much for him: for what a man cares for much, that he loves much; and what he loves much, that he will have as near to him as may be: Therefore if thou goeſt ſighing and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after other things, and canſt ſit down with contentment in the enjoyment of other things, this ſhews thou doſt prefer other things before God, and ſo doſt contemn him. If you can live without his love, you can live without his fear; and what is more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169957:95"/> horrid, then for a man to live without the love and fear of God? In <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. God argues this matter with his people; <hi>Fear ye not me, ſaith the Lord? will ye not tremble at my preſence, who have placed the ſand for the bound of the Sea by a perpetual decree? &amp;c. But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone: Neither ſay they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God, that giveth the former and latter rain in his ſeaſon, &amp;c.</hi> It is extream darkneſs that is upon you, even the darkneſs of Hell, when you can live quietly in the enjoyment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, without the knowledg of the love of God in Chriſt. All that have known God to be their God, when they are under doubts concerning this, when they are under the frowns of God; oh! how do they mourn? Lay but your ears to their cloſets, and hear their ſecret complaints, who can meaſure their tears, or number the ſighs and groans that are found with them, when they ſeek after God? <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. tells you how it was with him; he <hi>made his bed ſwim with tears, and his moiſture turned to dryneſs, his ſtrength was gone through the bitterneſs of his Soul,</hi> becauſe he could not ſee the love of God as formerly. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when that ineffable ſhadow was upon his ſpirit, how did he cry out, <hi>My God, my God,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169957:95"/> why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> It is therefore a contempt of God, when you can be without the knowledg that he hath pardoned you and accepted you in his Beloved.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Thoſe which ſeek not to clear their Intereſt, offer inexpreſsible violence to their own Souls. How the ſenſe of divine Love gives ſtrength to two uſeful principles of holy life.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT will further appear, that they are not right Chriſtians that can live without the knowledg of the love of God, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch live in unexpreſſible violence offered to their own Soul, and in moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid practiſes againſt themſelves. To inſtance and clear it. Are you content to live ſo baſely and vile in this world (when you know not that God is your God) as to rob and ſpoil your Souls of their trueſt Life, and to conſent and yield to that evil diſpoſition in them, to live on things that are dead, and that have but a ſhew of life? The ſpirit of a man will faſten on ſomething; if the ſpring of his life be not in God, if he have not life there, he will ſeek it where he can find it. When <hi>Cain</hi> went from the preſence of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169957:96"/> Lord, he fell to <hi>building</hi> of <hi>Cities.</hi> When <hi>Demas</hi> forſook Chriſt, what did he imbrace? even this <hi>preſent world.</hi> The <hi>Prodigal</hi> when he went from his fathers houſe fell on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and what was it but <hi>Hogs meat?</hi> When the <hi>Jews</hi> were driven from <hi>Zion,</hi> they made much of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Wilt thou ſee thy Soul feeding thus upon vanities, and not deal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually with thy ſelf to labor for ſelf-conviction, that thou mayſt return unto God? Say with thy ſelf, Where am I now? what am I doing? Is this to live on God? is this Eternal Life? Know you not that your life lies in the ſenſe and taſte of divine Love? Do you not find all other things to be dark and empty? And will you ſuffer your Souls againſt Nature to live out of God, when you are called to live on him who is the Fountain of Life? I may ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake in <hi>Job</hi> 15. <hi>Are the Conſolations of God ſmall to you?</hi> And is it ſo light a matter to have the knowledg of the love of God, and your Intereſt in him? In <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.18. the Prophet ſpeaks of <hi>ſpoiling and waſting;</hi> but if it doth come, ſaith he, <hi>thy ways and thy ſins have procured theſe things unto thee, therefore know that it is an evil thing and bitter to forſake the Lord.</hi> You may thank your ſelves, if a day come where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there will be bitterneſs to your hearts, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169957:96"/> the pangs of death upon you, becauſe you know not that God is your God; know that this is your wickedneſs, becauſe you will not now look after it, and ſo you rob your Souls. That is one thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. When you are not ſedulous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in this thing, to make ſure that God is your God, you leave your ſelves in the <hi>high way of Apoſtacy.</hi> What is that which will make us able to ſtand? the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure; for if you do theſe things, you ſhall never fall.</hi> You expoſe your ſelves to <hi>offences,</hi> to <hi>ſtumbling</hi> and <hi>falling,</hi> when you are content to live in the dark, not knowing what Intereſt you have in God. For conſider, you are now out of the <hi>ſhine</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> you are in the <hi>cold evening ſhade;</hi> your life is much weakened, and your ſtrength abated: It is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of divine Love that is the ſpirit and ſtrength of our love; this lays bonds upon our ſpirits, by which we become one with God; it is the wing of our Souls, the ſpring of our activity, by which we are born up to an enjoyment of God. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> And by this <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>more then a Conqueror;</hi> yet <hi>Paul</hi> had many Enemies: Through this <hi>Abraham</hi> was able to do ſo great things; by this <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:169957:97"/> was able to deſpiſe the wrath and favor of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all the pleaſures and riches of his Court. While a man walks in the ſhine and ſenſe of divine Love, he will feel a ſtrength in two Principles of great uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To <hi>cleave faſt to the chief good:</hi> now that chief good is God to that man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys him; he hath the trueſt taſte that ſees God to be his God, and no man elſe hath ſuch a taſte as he; this will hold him to God. Where the Creatures have but a Judgment of Senſe, they will not depart from what they find good: A Beaſt will not change his paſture for gold, that is beſt for him. It's the aſtoniſhment of the world, that the Angels ſhould fall from their ſtate of Glory; and it's matter of amazement, that man ſhould fall from his Creator, when he had a full enjoyment of him. It's that which God calls Heaven and Earth to tremble at, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. That <hi>men ſhould depart from him the Fountain of living Water, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>ſenſe</hi> of acceptation with God, makes a man that he cannot go from God: <hi>Whither ſhall we go?</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 6. <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> That Soul that lives under the influence of divine Comforts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay, <hi>Lord, it's good for me to be here;</hi> he deſires no change, it cannot be better with him: Change proceeds from want;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169957:97"/> for if want were not, the creature would not change. That Soul that enjoys God is pleaſed, and he ſaith with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 16. He <hi>hath a good portion,</hi> and his <hi>lines are fallen in a good place:</hi> Nothing is dear to that man to part with, that he may enjoy God; he bids all things ſtand by, and ſaith, I charge you, wife and friends, eſtate and all things, do not moleſt me in my enjoyment of the light of Gods face; let all the world go which way it will, let me enjoy this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to know aſſuredly that God is my God. When a man lives without this knowledg, his life is but a poor ſhadow of life; all without God is but a dead thing to him.</p>
               <p>Another Principle receiving ſtrength from the knowledg of Gods Love, and our Intereſt in him, is, <hi>That a man ſhould be friendly to his friend,</hi> that he ſhould walk with an harmony of ſpirit to his friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: Love pleaſeth not it ſelf. Now when a man enjoys the ſweetneſs of friendſhip with God, this makes him true to his Maker, and to cleave cloſe to God as to his Father: Indeed the ſenſe of this conſtrains; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. ſaith, <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us. How can I do this evil,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſeph, and ſin againſt my God?</hi> But now if thou be careleſs, and canſt make a ſhift to live I know not how, a dull ſtupid dark
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169957:98"/> ſenſleſs kind of life, thy heart not witneſſing that thou endeavoreſt to make good thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, thou art not under the bond of Love; and then what art thou under? Other Lovers have taken away thy heart, but as for God thou art a ſtranger to him, and art contented to be without him; this is a woful ſtate. And as a man that lives out of the ſhine of divine Love ſtarves and waſtes away, ſo fears in this caſe are apt to turn into hatred; when the Soul is gall'd and tormented with fears of the diſpleaſure of God againſt him, this is apt to turn to hatred. <hi>Naturally</hi> whom we <hi>fear</hi> we <hi>hate;</hi> and naturally the ſtronger fear is, the more men hate. The Devils hate God to the full, being paſt doubting of his diſpleaſure. What the Soul fears, it flies from; and what is the flight of the Soul but hatred? <hi>Judas</hi> would chuſe rather to go out of the world, and ſink into nothing, then endure his condition, when he ſaw God not to be his God. I'l ſhut up this Argument with theſe few things.</p>
               <p>All that is in a Chriſtian makes to this, that he would get a clear knowledg of his Intereſt in God. Hath he <hi>Faith?</hi> why by that he believes God to be his Happineſs, and that will put him on: Hath he <hi>Love? Love</hi> is reſtleſs but in clear enjoyment: Hath he <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>thirſt?</hi> what are they but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169957:98"/> the Souls ſickneſs till it hath health and life in the enjoyment of God? Hath he <hi>Fear?</hi> what is that but the Soul ſeeking to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and ſafe in God? Hath he <hi>Reaſon?</hi> what's that but the voyce of God calling him unto God? Hath he a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the ſweetneſs of God? what's that but the comfort of divine Love drawing the Soul to himſelf? So that all that is in a Chriſtian puts him on to this, to make this clear, that God is his God. And therefore they that can rub out their days, and make a ſhift, to buſie themſelves in other things, without the knowledg of God to be their God, have great cauſe to pronounce this heavy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon themſelves, that ſurely they are ſeparated from the love of God. So I have done with the third Argument.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Evil of Doubting as it is a denyal of the Truth of God, a diminution of his Love and Favors, and a miſ-interpretation of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations. The vexation of doubting to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened perſons in an evil day.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Fourth is this: <hi>Doubts</hi> in this caſe are very <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>grievous,</hi> eſpecially to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169957:99"/> a Soul in <hi>light,</hi> and to a Soul in <hi>trouble.</hi> To clear this, I will ſhew firſt, That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them exceeding great evil againſt God, in theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are contrary to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of God: They are a denyal of the Truth of God manifeſted in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by the teſtimony and witneſs of his Spirit: God hath made our way open to himſelf, and we are apt to ſay moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly as the Church in <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.44. <hi>He co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth himſelf with a Cloud, that our prayers ſhould not paſs through.</hi> He hath left upon you perhaps ſome marks of his love, he hath put into you ſome earneſt of his favor; what are theſe but the voyce of God from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that God is your God? and yet you ſay as the Church in her frowardneſs, <hi>The Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, It is not only oppoſite to his <hi>Truth,</hi> but to his <hi>Love.</hi> When a friend comes to one (paſſionately affected in ſuſpicion of his friendſhip) and ſaith to him, Sir, I love you, you are very dear to my heart; and he will not beleeve him, he takes it ill. God may ſay to us in the matter of his Love, as he ſaid to them in the matter of obedience, <hi>What could I have done more?</hi> God may ſay, <hi>I have given them the knowledg of my ſelf, I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169957:99"/> have given them a heart to love me, I have given them all the pledges of my dear Love; and yet they will ſit down in corners, and ſpend and waſte themſelves in mourning, becauſe I love them not: What can I do more?</hi> In <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.32. God took it ill when his Word could not be taken, and when the manifeſtation of his Love was of no force: <hi>Yet in this thing ye believed not the Lord your God, who went in the way before you, to ſearch out you a place to pitch his tent in, &amp;c. Surely,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>there ſhall not one man of this evil generation go to ſee that good Land, that would not believe me.</hi> It may be our hearts may be ſomewhat like <hi>Jobs,</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 9. ſaith he, <hi>If I have called, and he hath anſwered me; yet I will not believe that he will harken to my voyce.</hi> What a ſtrange thing is this? Though he hath heard me when I came to him, and hath given me entertainment of a Father, and I did receive pledges of his Love; yet I will not believe that He loves me, and that he will hear me.</p>
               <p>Again, They are diminutions of divine Favors: He that doubts his Intereſt, cannot ſo bleſs God in the enjoyment of wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and eſtate, and whatſoever carries ſweetneſs in it; but bitterneſs of Soul over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows, and makes all things bitter; and he is apt to overlook all, who is not perſwaded of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169957:100"/> his Intereſt in God. In <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.13. you read of the froward ſpirit of <hi>Haman,</hi> and ſuch a ſpirit is uſually in him that feareth; <hi>What is all this to me, ſeeing Mordecai ſits ſtill at the gate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another evil againſt God is, That theſe doubts cauſe miſ-interpretation of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Actions: They make a man miſ-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue God in all things, whatſoever he ſaith or doth: God ſhall not be taken aright by that man that doubts his Intereſt in him. O <hi>Job!</hi> how wert thou miſtaken, and what meaneſt thou to ſpeak thoſe words, <hi>Job</hi> 13.20. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thou thy face from me, and holdeſt me for thy enemy?</hi> Why, did God ever take thee for his enemy? So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, becauſe God croſſeth them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and fruſtrates them in their hopes; O, ſay they, God is angry with me, he doth not love me. I might tell you the ſame in other diſpenſations of God; indeed that man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Now we may conſider how painful and vexing doubting is in that man that is alive, that is in a living ſtate; and eſpecially in an evil day: There are theſe three things that clear it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This is a matter of greateſt conſequence,</hi> it's a buſineſs of the greateſt weight. See you not a man ſometimes, how heavily he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169957:100"/> walks when his eſtate is in queſtion? but much more when his life is in queſtion: But what if his life and eſtate too be in queſtion? That man that knows God truly, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endure the loſs of ten thouſand lives and eſtates, then the loſs of Gods favor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing that makes it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavy, is <hi>the loſs of the ſweetneſs of former experience. David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. complains of this, <hi>When I remember theſe things, I pour out my Soul in me; for I had gone with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, I went with them to the houſe of God, with the voyce of joy and praiſe, with the multitude that kept holy-day.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> in Chap. 29.2. <hi>O that it were with me as in the days of old, and in months paſt, as in the days when God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved me! when his Candle ſhined upon mine head, and when by his light I walk'd in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: As I was in my youth, when the ſecret of God was upon my tabernacle, and when the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was yet with me.</hi> Thus that man that loſeth the ſweetneſs of his former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, remembers the days of old, and that afflicts him.</p>
               <p>Again, God will have it ſo, that where this thing is not yet driven home, and the Soul hath not duly ſought, and ſo not found ſatisfaction concerning his Love, it ſhall be bitterneſs to him: I ſay, God will have it ſo, the Soul ſhall not enjoy it ſelf. He doth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169957:101"/> this, partly to give a demonſtration of his own Excellency, and to vindicate it in the Soul; that a man may ſurely know and find that there is none like him: therefore ſaith he, I will take away the light of my face from that man; he ſhall have his houſe, and land, and eſtate, and ſee what he will do with them, what he can make of them: And by this the love and favor of God appears to be excellent.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, God loves his people; he will have their love, and will have his love ſweetened to them, therefore it ſhall be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs to them when it is loſt. Be perſwaded then to make this your work, and reſt not till you know that you have Intereſt in God: plead with <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. <hi>Lord, ſay unto my Soul, thou art my Salvation;</hi> not only <hi>be my Salvation,</hi> but <hi>ſay thou art my Salvation:</hi> And then though you may have many ſad thoughts accompanying you, yet this will refreſh you in the midſt of all, as it did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.14. <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts thy comforts delight my Soul.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Intereſt in God more knowable then any other, and yet unknown to moſt: The Reaſons of both.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I propound the Directions, how they who are ſincere and ingenious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and indeed have him for their God, may know that they have a ſure Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Propriety in him, I will premiſe two things of moment.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That our Intereſt in God is <hi>more knowable</hi> then any other Intereſt in the world: There is no Intereſt that a man hath, which is <hi>ſo diſcernable:</hi> Whatſoever it is that belongs to an Intereſt in any thing, or any friend, and doth diſcover it; is much more here. Examine it in a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where there is an Intereſt with men, there is a <hi>mutual cloſing of their ſpirits,</hi> by which they know one another, and come to reſt ſecure in each others good intentions and hearty wiſhes. Here alſo is this mutual cloſing, and in a far more high and excellent degree, then is or can be with any creature: For that affection and love which God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to his people, and which he doth act
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169957:102"/> upon them, is a Love that is tranſcendent; that is, not only beyond all other love, but beyond all underſtanding: That entire clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that is between a Beleever and God in Jeſus Chriſt, is above all that which can be found in any other; his whole Soul runs this way. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. <hi>I have ſought thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) with my whole heart.</hi> That is the proportion which God hath cut out for himſelf. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy might.</hi> Chriſt challenges the ſame proportion, and indeed it ſhould not be leſs; leſs would not fulfil his end, which is the ſolid peace and <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of him; and alſo the <hi>ſubjecting</hi> and <hi>ſubduing</hi> of their ſpirits to his <hi>government:</hi> No proportion of love loſs then the greateſt, could work theſe things.</p>
               <p>But beſides this, there is ſuch a <hi>through change</hi> by reaſon of this Intereſt, as no Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the world doth work, though the cloſeſt and the neareſt: For the habit and diſpoſition of the ſpirit of a man is altered in cloſing with God, and he becomes a new creature, he is not what he was. It is true, that in all friendſhip that is with men, there is a kind of change on both ſides, becauſe there muſt be a due and neceſſary applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves to each others ſpirits;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169957:102"/> but that change is unſpeakably inferior to this, in thoſe who have been wrought upon to beleeve, and have obtained this mercy to cloſe with God: for they are changed to the proportion of as great a diſtance, as death is diſtant from life, and darkneſs from light; for they are brought off from the love of all that, on which their hearts were ſet, even to a hatred of it; and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſubordinate, and conformed to the Will of God.</p>
               <p>There is another thing in this Intereſt, which belongs to the nature of it, and ſo diſcovers it, and that is, a <hi>mutual converſing with each other with contentment. Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had much pleaſure in their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual converſings with each other, and in drawing forth their ſpirits one to another. This is much more ſtrong in Beleevers, then can be in any relation between husband and wife, or between the father and child. This muſt needs be ſo:</p>
               <p>For, firſt, The <hi>love</hi> wherewith they love God is the <hi>higheſt love:</hi> Therefore many will not go for Chriſtians, that pretend to be ſuch, becauſe their hearts are not brought up to this. The higheſt Love acts higheſt, it takes the higheſt delight and contentment in its Object. In <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>As the Apple trees among the trees of the Forreſt, ſo is my Beloved
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169957:103"/> among the ſons: I ſat down under his ſhadow with great delight, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, It is good for me to draw near to God:</hi> That look as others find contentment in the things they love, and draw near to them; ſo the Saints find much more contentment with God, and therefore draw near to him.</p>
               <p>Again, Friends cannot <hi>always</hi> enjoy theſe Converſes: <hi>Oftentimes</hi> they are parted, and ſo cannot have this felicity of expreſſing mutual love; but God is <hi>ever</hi> with them. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Thou art my ſtrong habitation, to whom I may have a continual reſort:</hi> I may always come to thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a third thing in Intereſt, and that is <hi>mutual Communication.</hi> Love is a ſpring, which flows forth; it doth enjoy what it hath rather for its friend, then for it ſelf: Gods Love hath this excellency more abundantly and tranſcendently. Take the deareſt friends that live at the higheſt rate of love, they cannot maintain a conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; partly becauſe there is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an equal neceſſity and capacity, partly becauſe there is not always the ſame power to give forth. But our neceſſities are always very great and vaſt, and Gods power is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame; ſo that here is always a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Communication of Love that ceaſeth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169957:103"/> not, but flows forth as beams of light from the Sun.</p>
               <p>Now as effects diſcover their cauſes, ſo then eſpecially when they are moſt full and perfect. As you may better know any tree by its fruit, then when it is in the bud and bloſſoms; and you may better know it when the fruit is in its fulneſs and in more abundance, then when there are but a few; if there be but one or two upon a tree they may be hid, but when there are many, the teſtimony is the more abundant: Abundant are the teſtimonies of the fruits of Gods Love in what he hath done for his. So that upon this account, no <hi>Intereſt</hi> is more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then that of a Beleever in his God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is this; That though no Intereſt be <hi>more knowable,</hi> yet ordinarily no Intereſt <hi>is leſs known</hi> then this. This we need not prove; I think it's a Queſtion out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with us all. The <hi>unevenneſs</hi> of the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> of Beleevers in their walkings, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy</hi> of their <hi>rejoycing,</hi> are two ſtrong <hi>demonſtrations</hi> of this, that they do know but little of their <hi>Intereſt</hi> in God. It ſprings from ſuch unhappy <hi>Cauſes</hi> as theſe, That <hi>abiding Unbelief,</hi> that <hi>bitter root</hi> that hath taken ſuch ſtrong hold of the nature of man, that till the whole houſe be pull'd down, it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169957:104"/> will not be wholly eradicated and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: This is that <hi>weight</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of (in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.) that <hi>hangs on us ſo faſt,</hi> as is manifeſt by the Apoſtle's ſcope, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading unto faith, and the workings of faith; this is that (ſaith he) that ſo ſuppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and bears us down from thoſe heights of heavenly joy, from that ſweet contentment and reſt of ſpirit whereto we are called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beleeving</hi> is the <hi>firſt ſtone</hi> that is layd in a Chriſtian. <hi>He that comes to God, muſt beleeve that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of thoſe that ſeek him, Hebr.</hi> 12. And as there is a ſpirit in all Beleevers that tends to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them upon a ſure foundation, that they may ſtedfaſtly beleeve: ſo there is a ſpirit that works to unbelief, perplexity and diſſettlement. While unbelief works in us, it muſt needs be, that there will be a great want of that through knowledg of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this great miſery of man, is, That Gods <hi>communications</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us, and <hi>entertainments</hi> of us, are not always in <hi>intelligible forms,</hi> ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preſently take them up, and underſtand the meaning and good-will of God in them. The fault is in our minds. The <hi>print</hi> is good, but cannot be read, becauſe the <hi>eye</hi> is <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>dark.</hi> Sometimes God comes to us wrapt up
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169957:104"/> in Clouds, and indeed he varies his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, that he may attain his End: His End is this, that he may work his people to a ſtrength of Faith and Love mixt with Fear; that's the proper conſtitution of a Chriſtian, and the trueſt temper of one that is marked out to eternal life. Therefore God ſometimes diſplays his <hi>greatneſs</hi> in the ſight of his people, far above all the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of his mercy; that the ſpirit of a poor man is overborn, ſhakes and trembles at the preſence of God: So it was with <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 12.21. The <hi>ſight was ſo terrible</hi> (though God meant no ill to <hi>Moſes) that Moſes ſhakes and quakes for fear, he was ſore afraid.</hi> Sometimes God comes with the manifeſtations of his fatherly diſpleaſure and diſlike, and then how can it be but the Soul muſt dwell in bitterneſs? mourning, heavineſs and trembling muſt needs poſſeſs us.</p>
               <p>A third <hi>Cauſe</hi> why ſo little is known of this Intereſt, that God is our God, though he be ſo, is our <hi>unhappy diverſions.</hi> We are oftentimes turned off from that one thing neceſſary, and our ſpirits run otherways, out of light into darkneſs. Alas, <hi>Solomon</hi> mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not this matter, or to little purpoſe, when he poured out his Soul after vanities; and for this God pleaded with him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.9.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169957:105"/> that he had departed from him; <hi>The Lord was wrath with Solomon, becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, who had appeared to him twice.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the knowledg of bleſſed Intereſt in God may be attained. Deſires to have the queſtion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. A ſpirit free to yield to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. Arguments proper for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the queſtion. Thoſe that have an Intereſt in God are much in holy reſignation. Of <hi>taking</hi> anſwers when they are <hi>given.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeſe things being premiſed, now I come to ſhew you how we may attain this bleſſed knowledg, that God is ours, and ſo quiet our hearts in this aſſurance, that he is our Portion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let it be the <hi>true deſire</hi> of thy Soul to have this <hi>queſtion determined and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> that God is thy God. Certainly many are careleſs concerning this buſineſs, that never much debate the matter, whether God be their God, or no. Others there are that have care enough, but it is a <hi>perplexed care,</hi> a care <hi>ſowred</hi> with <hi>unbelief;</hi> there is a deſire indeed <hi>raiſed,</hi> but it's mixed with <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation;</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:169957:105"/> the Soul is indeed in motion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, but it is a very diſorderly motion; working with fretting, and ſuch diſturbing fears, that they leave themſelves without judgment. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. It is ſaid concerning the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>when Moſes ſpake to them they would not hear him, for their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of ſpirit, and for their cruel bondage;</hi> for <hi>the ſhortneſs and ſtraitneſs of their ſpirits.</hi> Fears do ſtraiten.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond Means is this; Come with a <hi>ſpirit free to yield</hi> to the determination of truth one way or other; take your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from God as he ſhall give it. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there are a generation that know that they are very partial and fooliſh in this buſineſs, that fly from the deciſion and determination of this queſtion, from a ſecret ſtrong ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that all is not well with them; and therefore they will rather flatter themſelves with the uncertainty of their own eſtate, then affright themſelves with the clear knowledg of their unhappy condition. As a guilty priſoner fears to think of the time of Judgment, becauſe he knows there is juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion that it ſhall go ill with him. Poor man! what ſhall it profit thee to carry things thus? If God be not thy God, what hurt is it for thee to know it? He that lives thus refuſeth the judgment of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169957:106"/> God, and as much as in him lies hates the judgment of God. There can be no greater evidence of a right ſpirit, then for a man to put the queſtion home, whether God be his: for that man is not willing to be the Lords, that is not willing to have it determined, whether he be his or no.</p>
               <p>Some again are ſo poſſeſſed and <hi>overcome with fears,</hi> ſo ready to <hi>ſelf-condemnation,</hi> to what ever may afflict and oppreſs them, that they wrap themſelves up in thick clouds, leſt any light ſhould ſpring forth upon them: Theſe are like unjuſt Judges, that are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant in their proceedings, that hear only one party. It is a dangerous thing for a man to miſtake in Judgment; as the Wiſe-man ſpeaks concerning Civil Judgment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>He that juſtifies the wicked, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the juſt, even they both are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God.</hi> You diſpleaſe God, and ſin againſt Truth and Righteouſneſs, when you bear down your ſelves, and pronounce a ſentence of death upon your own Souls, when God hath paſſed the ſentence of life and peace upon you: You croſs the deſign of Jeſus Chriſt, which is a deſign of love and peace: You offer violence to that light, reaſon and ſpirit which God hath ſet up in you: You tempt God to ſay as you do, and to make good your words. Be therefore
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169957:106"/> willing to hear what God ſhall ſay to you, as they in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. ſaid to <hi>Peter, We are all here ready to hear the things that are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third Means is, To proceed and <hi>argue by proper Mediums,</hi> by ſuch <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> as are <hi>proper</hi> to the Queſtion. Some work themſelves into a good opinion by <hi>falſe diſcourſes;</hi> concluding upon inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grounds that God is their God, either from an empty appearance of good, or elſe from a real preſence of the life of ſuch things as may flow from other principles then the ſpirit of Adoption; as the fear of God, mourning for ſin, ſubjection of ſpirit to the Commands of God; which things indeed are good, but may flow from another ſpring then the ſpirit of Adoption.</p>
               <p>But if you would conclude in a right way of reaſoning, that God is your God, argue then by ſuch things as are proper to that ſtate and relation wherein you ſuppoſe your ſelves to be toward God; and that is, in one word, <hi>a ſpirit of true Love:</hi> You ſhall find that working thus; it will carry thy Soul in <hi>propenſions</hi> towards God, equal to thy <hi>conſolations:</hi> The Soul that loves, is carried unto God with deſires equal to its refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yea and more; for when it cannot taſte the comforts of the Almighty, yet it is
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169957:107"/> carried after him in deſires, and ſaith, Lord, I will love thee, though thou wilt not love me. This love alſo will work <hi>reſignation</hi> of our ſelves to God, equal to all our <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>expectations</hi> from God. <hi>David</hi> was much taken with Gods love to him that tendred him in his diſtreſſes, but withall ſaith he, <hi>Lord, I am thy ſervant, Pſal.</hi> 106. He gave himſelf to God in the ſenſe of the ſweetneſs of that mercy he had from God. Yea this will exceed alſo; for he will give himſelf to God, when he knows not but that God hath hid himſelf from him. This love will work equal melting of ſpirit with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of ſpirit, and fill a man equally with ſhame and joy. True love makes a man as happy in ſorrowing, as in rejoycing; and he never more abounds in godly ſorrow, then when he abounds in the manifeſtation of Gods love to him. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. you may ſee how <hi>David</hi> was taken after he found mercy with God, ſee how he breaks forth deteſting his own nature, and the natures of all men; he compares them to <hi>the horſe and mule:</hi> like <hi>Aſaph</hi> in another caſe, <hi>So brutiſh was I and ignorant as a beaſt before thee.</hi> Now if you would know whether God be your God, what do you find of ſuch a ſpirit in you?</p>
               <p>Some conclude too well in a falſe way,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169957:107"/> by falſe Arguments. Some indeed too who beleeve, conclude too ill, to their own wrong, by miſtakes alſo; as becauſe they find their feet ſlipping, and their ways not ſo even, therefore they conclude their ſpirits are crooked, and there is no ſtreightneſs in them: whereas it is not the action, but the diſpoſition, whereby we ſhould judg our ſelves; nor is it this or that tripping that diſcovers a man, but the inward frame of his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Again, They conclude, Surely God is not my God, becauſe I feel my love ſo faint, my faith ſo feeble; whereas it is not the degree, but the truth of grace, that muſt diſcover our eſtates.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A fourth Means is this, Labor to be <hi>more full</hi> in <hi>cloſing with God,</hi> and in the <hi>reſignation of your ſelves</hi> to him, and in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing</hi> with him, in all delightfulneſs, and in whatſoever it is that ſhews your Intereſt in God: For as there is a light in all theſe, by which they bear witneſs of themſelves, and of your happy ſtate; ſo the fuller and ſtronger they are, the more clear, full and vigorous is their teſtimony. A tender plant newly ſpringing from the ground doth not ſo well diſcover what it is, as when it is grown up to a full body; now it is eaſily known. This is certain, things are more
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169957:108"/> ſignificant as they are more perfect. A little ſmoak diſcovers fire, but more ſmoak is more full in its diſcovery: This the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> intimates, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If theſe things be lacking, if men be but weak in theſe,</hi> if men be not only not ſound, but little in theſe; they are dark-ſighted, they cannot well diſcern things; their judgments will be very much clouded and darkened in the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their peace. Be frequent therefore in thoſe works that diſcover your Intereſt, be frequent in converſing with God, frequent in expreſſions of the ſincerity of your Love: for it is with God as it is with us; diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of our Love make diſcoveries of his Love. When I ſay to a friend, Sir, I love you, you are dear to me, and I am wholly yours; his heart opens to me, and there is an eccho in his ſpirit to my Love. When you come to God, and ſay, Father, I am thine, and will be thine, wholly thine, and always thine; if your Love can make you ſay ſo to God, much more the Love of God will make him ſay ſo to you, Thou art mine. In <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. <hi>They ſhall ſay, Thou art our God, and I will ſay, Thou art my people.</hi> Therefore be much in this.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Be <hi>true to your Intereſt,</hi> walk with a ſtreight ſpirit, make ſtreight paths to your feet; for upon ſuch ſhall peace be: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169957:108"/> 
                  <hi>Great peace have they that keep thy Laws.</hi> God bears the cleareſt teſtimony, where there is moſt excellent walking. Uſually his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is according to the meaſure of grace, as the co-operation of the Spirit alſo is: And as God comes with the moſt terrible convictions upon higheſt tranſgreſſors, ſo he comes with ſweeteſt conſolations to thoſe that walk moſt evenly. Uneven walking carries a ſhew of inſincerity, and puts a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty upon beleeving. <hi>David</hi> had much ado (in this caſe) to conclude himſelf to be Gods; was a ſhattered man, and had loſt his confidence. The Conſcience of guilt to an Unbeleever is deadly, and even to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever it is a wound. You put a ſword into your enemies hand, when you walk not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly: You arm your unbelief againſt your ſelves; that is too ſtrong without your help. This is certain, that no hope conquers fear, but that which conquers ſin; for they have both one foundation. If therefore now you would know, and would walk in this light, that God is your God; then you muſt walk uprightly and faithfully in your Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Take anſwers of Love when they are given you,</hi> and <hi>keep them,</hi> treaſure them up as moſt precious things; bleſs Jeſus Chriſt by whom it is that you enjoy them, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169957:109"/> not the great queſtion of thy Soul to be always in agitation: Suffer not thy ſelf to be brought to endleſs diſputes, when the cauſe is once heard and concluded. It is as well ſinful to make voyd the grounds of our Conſolations, as to break the bonds and cords whereby God holds us to obedience. You put gold no more to the touch-ſtone when it hath once paſſed the furnace; you ſay it is gold. Suffer not your ſelves to be toſſed in whirls of amazement, when God hath ſaid he is your God. It is true indeed, there will be objections, and they cannot be ſhunned, they are often injected; yet theſe things muſt ſometimes paſs undiſputed. Mark the ſeaſon when theſe things are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in your Souls; commonly at the worſt ſeaſon, when a man is at greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. When <hi>Job</hi>'s ſpirit was diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you know what amazement he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and what advantage did it take of him?</p>
               <p>Another ſeaſon is the ſeaſon of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Devil ſo works in our unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hearts, that we oftentimes put that to the queſtion, that God before hath put out of queſtion. Offences ſhould not work in us amazement and fear of our former bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but they ſhould work in us brokenneſs and ſhame. <hi>Lord, pardon me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, for
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169957:109"/> my ſin is very great.</hi> The greater our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion is, the more we ſhould have recourſe to God and his goodneſs; but by no means fly from him. Certainly Gods deſign is to break ſin by ſin, and his aym is to out-ſhoot the Devil in his own Bow. Oh! they love much to whom much is forgiven. The end of this diſcourſe is, that you would be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſolemn and impartial in debating of this buſineſs; for when God hath cleared the matter, it is to thy hurt to bring it about to be diſputed again.</p>

                  <p>What it is to live upon God as our God. No other life appointed for Saints. The fulneſs, beauty and ſatisfaction of this life. How Chriſtians offer violence to their relation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN this Chapter I would make Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all that have Intereſt in God, to live upon it: Only firſt I will ſhew what it is to live upon God, as our God. And it is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To <hi>cleave</hi> to God with <hi>joy of heart,</hi> to live in the <hi>affectionate embraces</hi> of God in Chriſt, and <hi>delightful converſings</hi> with him; to have God for our <hi>life;</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> concerning <hi>Benjamin, His Soul, his life
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169957:110"/> was bound up in the life of the child, Gen.</hi> 44.13. that is, they had one lot, if one lived the other lived, their joys were the ſame, they could not be ſevered or parted, they were but as one: So we ſhould be towards God, our lives ſhould be ſo bound up in him, we ſhould be one with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To live upon God, is to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> all our <hi>deſires</hi> into God, to have none but what are <hi>for</hi> him, and <hi>according</hi> to him. This is the way of life indeed, when God is a mans all, when the language of his Soul is, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee?</hi> Thus to have deſires to God, that he reſts not in any thing beneath God, nor ſeek any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God; that is to live in God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To live in a <hi>faithful real reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of ones ſelf unto God. If you be his, you know that he hath <hi>taken, choſen and ſet apart the good man for himſelf, Pſal.</hi> 4. And ſo muſt we live as ſequeſtred perſons, as thoſe that are his; that as the holy things of the Temple were for no other uſe, ſo muſt we be only for God. In <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3. 'tis ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt abide with me many days, thou ſhalt not play the harlot, thou ſhalt not be for another man, but ſhalt be unto me; ſo will I alſo be for thee.</hi> God will ſtand cloſe to that ſpirit, and be the comfort, ſtay and life of it, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it ſelf for him.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:169957:110"/>
               <p>Fourthly, It is to <hi>contract and draw all your expectations</hi> upon God, to lay all your weight there. If there be any thing thou promiſeſt thine own heart, let it be from the boſom of God; if there be any anſwer that thou makeſt to the fears, doubts and troubles of thy ſpirit, let it be from the voyce of the Lord. Thus <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.2. <hi>He only is my Rock, and my Salvation; he is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I ſhall not be greatly moved.</hi> And he ſaith at verſ. 5. <hi>My Soul, wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him.</hi> He tells you what God is to him, and what indeed he looks for from God: What God is to him, He is my Rock and my Salvation, in God is my Salvation and my Glory, he is the Rock of my ſtrength. He tells you alſo what he expects from God; My Refuge is from him: ſo that if I need ſafety or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſupply of any good, mine eye is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and from him I look for all. This is to live upon God.</p>
               <p>Having expreſſed in a few words what it is to live upon God; Now take thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which perſwade to live ſuch a life as this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>There is no other life for you:</hi> This is appointed for you, to this you are called, for this you are fitted. Fiſhes may as well live in the ayr, as you live in the world. You
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169957:111"/> may try and weary out your ſelves in vain, but God is your life. This be ſure of, if you neglect this life, either dulneſs and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs will fall upon you, ſo that you will grow ſenſual, brutiſh and earthly, ſtrangers to the joy, activity and tenderneſs of holy Chriſtians; or you ſhall fall into a diſ-reſt, an unſufferable unquietneſs of ſpirit, while you are as a rouling thing in the wind, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no conſiſtence, becauſe you are out of your place. You ſhall be afflicted within; and this will be your great evil, that you lived not in God: And now becauſe you ſeek life in other things, you ſhall dig for your own death. And if you have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it will work to your own affliction, vex and torment your Souls night and day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you did not walk in the counſels of the Moſt high, and the embracements of his Love: Your ſweeteſt enjoyments will be all ſowred, like the waters of <hi>Jericho,</hi> bitterneſs will be in them not to be endured.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is a life that ſhould be <hi>moſt pleaſing,</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> unto our ſpirits; and certainly we are dead and alienated from God, if there be not an incomparable ſweetneſs to us in it. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>fulleſt</hi> life. The life of all other things hath ſomething <hi>mixed</hi> with it; the life of your enjoyments, your pleaſures
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169957:111"/> and relations, is a mixt life; there is death in all your comforts, and you taſte it, and are ſick of it many times; you know it well. It is true, there is nothing that God hath made and appointed for our uſe, but brings in ſome portion of life; our garments give a little, and our food a little, and friends give ſomething; but how little do all theſe give? But now this life is all life; the life you have from other things is a ſhort poor narrow life, but this life is more compleat. Take the life of a man that hath whatſoever his heart can wiſh, his comforts ſtrike but upon his ſenſe, or at beſt have but ſome light touch upon his ſpirit: Alas! the Souls of men cannot drink at theſe Ciſterns: Life that comes from theſe things, hath not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality in it; ſuch things are as far from immortality, as they are from ſufficiency. The wiſeſt, the richeſt, and moſt honorable, that have the fulleſt life, dye, becauſe the life they have by ſuch things cannot hold pace with the Soul, nor communicate a life of conſiſtency: But the life we have with God, extends to the whole courſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Soul; it fills up every corner, and leaves no want.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a life that gives <hi>perfect ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> he can ask no more that hath it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a life that <hi>beautifies</hi> the Soul. Mens
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169957:112"/> complexions uſually are as their dyet is: Oh, he that feeds on God, what a rare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion is his Soul of? It makes him like to God; it reduceth a Soul from a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſeparation, into a bleſſed and orderly union. Our life being in one God, one Good, which is all Good; he that lives this life, would dye ten thouſand deaths rather then part with it. Thou well kneweſt <hi>Peter</hi> what thou ſaidſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. When Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Will ye alſo go away?</hi> then <hi>Simon Peter</hi> anſwered, <hi>To whom ſhall we go, Lord? Thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> Whither doſt thou think we can go? when we knew thee not, we could indeed be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee; but now we know thee, whither ſhall we go? When Nature comes to a ſtate of Conſiſtency, it reſts, it ſeeks no more: That man is in ſuch a ſtate, that is in God, that enjoys him and his Love, and reſts in him; he lives in an holy content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a glorious reſt in all things that are according to God, and in a hatred of all things that are in oppoſition to God. If any thing come into the ballance with God, if it be like God, he loves it; but if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God, he hates it: having once drunk of the new wine, he deſires not the old harſh ſpiritleſs wine.</p>
               <p>You may remember the Catalogue of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169957:112"/> Saints in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. when you are come to their pitch, then God will be dear to you, and there will be a flatneſs upon all things elſe. The <hi>life</hi> of every thing is according to its <hi>compaſs,</hi> and the thing by which it is maintained. <hi>Men</hi> have a better life then <hi>beaſts,</hi> for they have better things to live on: <hi>Princes</hi> live better lives then <hi>beggers,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> then <hi>men,</hi> becauſe they have better things to live on. Now then, if your life be in God, you have the beſt and ſweeteſt life. We judg of lives in the world by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment they have that live in them; now in this life you find <hi>innumerable Angels, the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect; Jeſus Chriſt lives this life,</hi> and thinks it enough, he deſires no better life; God himſelf lives this life, he lives in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third thing is, That if you do not <hi>maintain</hi> this life, you offer <hi>unſpeakable violence</hi> to that bleſſed <hi>ſtation</hi> and happy <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> wherein God hath ſet you. One of theſe two things you muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you live not on God, <hi>God is not your portion;</hi> you have not taken him for your God, you have not clos'd with him, and then you are undone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or this muſt be granted, If you have cloſed with him, you <hi>wrong God</hi> and <hi>your
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169957:113"/> ſelves</hi> extreamly, becauſe you live not on him. Hath God taken you? and have you taken him? Hath he ſaid to thee, <hi>My Spouſe?</hi> and hath thy Soul ſaid to him, <hi>My Lord</hi> and <hi>my Husband?</hi> And ſhall we live upon other things, and not upon our <hi>Husband?</hi> Shall the <hi>child</hi> live on <hi>ſtrangers</hi> bread, and not upon his <hi>Father?</hi> Shall the ſon of a Prince hang as a begger upon others doors, and be a ſtranger to his Fathers love, to his Fathers houſe and fulneſs? This is certain, that ſo far as you do this, you are not children, but Prodigals (in <hi>Luke</hi> 15. laſt) dead and loſt. While you are out of God, and your hearts ſet on other things, you are in a ſtate of dead men, in an abſolute indiſpoſedneſs and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, either to the fulfilling of that which lies upon you as the Law of your relation unto God, or to the enjoyment of that which is the ſweetneſs, priviledg and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your relation unto God. Is ſhe a <hi>wife</hi> think you, or doth ſhe not offer violence to the Law of her Relation, that refuſeth bed and board with her husband? You <hi>ſhould drink water out of your own Ciſtern,</hi> from your own <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Spring;</hi> who is that but your Lord and Head whom you have choſen? God will not endure that you ſhould wander; He will <hi>hedg up your way,</hi> as he ſpeaks in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. and thoſe hedges will
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169957:113"/> teer you. He is pleaſed with you when you lean on him, and take of his Love, and then <hi>his joy is fulfilled in you,</hi> you do what he loves, he takes contentment in it. Other comforts are <hi>ſtoln; ſweet</hi> they may be in the <hi>taſte,</hi> but they will be <hi>bitterneſs</hi> in your <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els;</hi> it muſt be ſo: for when you live any where but in God, you croſs his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which is to make himſelf your Center, wherein your Souls ſhould reſt: He hath appointed no place for thy Soul to reſt in but his own boſom; You deſpiſe him when you ſuffer the joys of your Souls to be clouded. If <hi>Elkanah</hi> could ſay to his wife, <hi>Am not I better to thee then ten ſons?</hi> Surely God may ſay much more, <hi>Am not I better to thee then ten ſuch things as theſe that thou art troubled at?</hi> So that if your hearts go out any other way, it is againſt all reaſon. Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 4.10. made account, that the Soul hath enough that taſtes of this; for he ſaith, <hi>he ſhall never thirſt more.</hi> Go no more then to the <hi>hedges</hi> and <hi>high ways;</hi> thou that haſt ſuch a God and ſuch a Friend, be quiet and reſt in his Love: He <hi>reſts in his love to you, Zech.</hi> 3.17. And will not you reſt in it, and lie down in his arms and embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſay, It is <hi>ſweet,</hi> it is <hi>enough?</hi> Is not he always embracing you, and cheering you, and holding forth the breſts of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169957:114"/> to you? wooing and winning you, and uſing all means to fill your Souls with himſelf, and to make you bleſſed in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him? If then you have any fear of his diſpleaſure, if you have any ſweetneſs and comfort of the Love of God, if you have taſted and known how good the Lord is; then keep faſt to him, and maintain your Souls in a conſtant living communion with him: If you keep near him, you ſhall find that there is life in him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.32. <hi>They ſhall live that ſeek the Lord.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Heavenly life neareſt at hand. Chriſtians are to live up to the height of it, and to maintain it in every condition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Fourth Argument is, That this life we ſpeak of is moſt <hi>preſent,</hi> it is <hi>neareſt</hi> at hand, moſt attainable, being wholly <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and thoſe works are <hi>quickeſt</hi> done. All other life comes in by <hi>parcels</hi> and <hi>pieces:</hi> If a man would live in honor, what a deal ado is there? what a compaſs muſt he fetch to maintain good thoughts with this man and with that man? and his honor riſeth by degrees: The like may be ſaid
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169957:114"/> concerning pleaſures and riches. Nay na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally what a courſe doth the Soul take to bring in that meat which ſupplies our life, in eating, concocting and digeſting it, and carrying it to every part? The labour of Nature is great. But this life is maintained by a ſweet and ſilent working of Spirit; it is a life that is got, kept and cheriſhed by the ſweeteſt actings of the Soul. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.6. ſaith <hi>David, I ſhall be fill'd as with marrow and fatneſs, when I remember thee upon my bed.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7. you have this expreſt by the like words, <hi>Some truſt in Charets, and ſome in Horſes:</hi> Great preparations they make; but what is his truſt? <hi>I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Name of the Lord our God.</hi> This is life, to remember the Name of the Lord our God: It is the beſt <hi>exerciſe of the moſt noble part of a man</hi> towards the moſt excellent Object. And what ſhould we love more to look upon and to remember, then God? Do not you find how a few affectionate thoughts of him come down in ſhowres of ſpiritual bleſſing and conſolation? Both the Goodneſs of God and the Love of God makes this work ſweet. He that ſeeks to live this way, hath not only ſweetneſs in his end, but in the way to it. Remember how ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful you have found this courſe: What unſpeakable effuſions of inward refreſhing
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169957:115"/> have you found upon turning of your ſpirits unto God, upon the very caſt of your eye upon the Father of Mercies? Alas for thoſe poor Souls, thoſe wandering Beggers, even all men that do not come in, and that have not God for their God in Chriſt! It is pity and grief to ſee what a poor life they live, and they know it not: How do they ſweat and toyl for that which they never get? They get but the image of what they aim at: For what do they work? For life, they think; but they work themſelves out of life, not into life: they are knocking always at that door where nothing is, where vanity and emptineſs dwells; they are digging pits that will hold no water; they are ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grapes on thorns, and figs on thiſtles. But this way is ſure and ſweet; you are ſure to find; and your ſweetneſs is as well in ſeeking as in finding.</p>
               <p>Let Chriſtians then endeavor to live this life: How can we without ſhame complain, that we are dead and broken in ſpirit, that a weight lies upon our Souls, that we are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when life is ſo near us? when the Well is not deep, and we might take of the water of Life, and drink freely? Men will not improve the activity and nimbleneſs of their Souls to enrich themſelves. We oftentimes charge God with hiding his face from us,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169957:115"/> but wrongfully; he turns not away his face from us, we turn from him: we go out of the Sun-ſhine into the cold ſhade, and then we ſhake by reaſon of cold. But thoſe looks of God, which are eaſily had in Jeſus Chriſt, warm and chear the Soul. Have not ſuch a thought in your hearts, that holy Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are hardly gotten: You wrong the Fountain of Life, if you think that you may draw and find nothing; or that you may let down your bucket, and bring it up emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: theſe are blaſphemies, which our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving hearts form againſt God. Certainly God is eaſie to be entreated, and to be found of thoſe that ſeek him. <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. had hard thoughts of him; but when he once tryed him, though he came in the blackneſs and dread of his Soul, covered over with ſhame and confuſion, yet he found God to be to him <hi>according to all his Name,</hi> and <hi>according to all his Word;</hi> his tears were wiped away, and his broken bones were ſet again, and he was ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>I would yet a little more clearly expreſs this thing, and winde up the Exhortation to its juſt height, in two words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we endevor to <hi>live this life in the higheſt degree,</hi> that is, to live <hi>very much</hi> in God; not only to have a <hi>true</hi> life, but a life <hi>proportionable</hi> to our <hi>relation</hi> unto him.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169957:116"/> Princes ſhould feed as Princes, and their life ſhould be like their place: So ſhould Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have their life proportionable to what God is. What God is in himſelf, he is to us, if we have accepted Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt. Meer peace is too low a temper for a Chriſtian; he is never like himſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he live in joy: his principles reach to all joy; and for that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> pray'd, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. Saints might as well live like <hi>Princes</hi> in faith and joy, as with feeble hopes, ſome weak conſolations; they might as well drink a <hi>full draught,</hi> as <hi>taſte</hi> of the goodneſs and kindneſs of God. Who ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens you? What is your life, but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eſpouſing of your ſelves unto God? and ſhould not there be much joy on the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age day? Therefore the Apoſtle prays in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>The God of peace fill you with all peace and joy always, [All peace, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond word is, <hi>That you maintain this life in every ſtate.</hi> No variation of our outward eſtate in this life, ſhould be any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the glory of this life. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing you have by Faith, and ſpiritual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, ſhould not be dampt by any thing. Is our fellowſhip with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt? Can we ſay ſo? Then what ſhould all the turnings of this
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169957:116"/> world be to us? How unſuitable to this Communion is it, to have our <hi>ſpirits turned,</hi> and our <hi>joys changed</hi> with outward things? Suppoſe it be well with us in the world, and we be pleaſed; yet is it fit for the Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of eternal life, who have alſo a ſenſe of the ſweetneſs of enjoying God, to be much taken with theſe things? Is there not a Crown prepared for us? Is not God our God? Can we be content to be ſo taken with the diſhes at a feaſt, as to forget our friend at the table, and that our beſt friend? Suppoſe it be ill with us, as we commonly account ill; though the truth is, it is never ill with a good man, it doth but appear ill; it ſeems ill, but it is all good and well; for all is from goodneſs and love; therefore though it be ill with us, in this ſence, yet let us be in our own temper, that is, rejoyce in God: Though nothing be the ſame, yet if God be the ſame, let us be the ſame. Meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that famous place, <hi>Habak.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat; the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls: Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> This is that which God calls for, that you live in him always. Whatſoever fails, ſay as
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169957:117"/> the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. <hi>God is my portion for ever.</hi> I have a Father in Heaven, and ſo though I find things bad enough here, yet it is well, it is well, well above and well within.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Further Conſiderations to promote the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned life, of its incomparable worth. Thoſe that will not live the life of Faith, ſhall not. A firm belief of the Goſpel the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Life.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEt us now take a few things more into conſideration, to promote our living in God; for we have need of all cords to <hi>draw</hi> us and <hi>bind</hi> us to this life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, the <hi>unutterable difference</hi> that is between this life, and any other <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable</hi> or <hi>imaginable.</hi> Harken to all that can judg, every thing ſpeaks in the Caſe; eſpecially take the teſtimony of God, and of thoſe whom he hath bleſſed with the beſt enjoyment of himſelf: You know what God ſaith of himſelf, and what glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions he hath made of that <hi>abſoluteneſs</hi> and <hi>incomprehenſible goodneſs</hi> which is in him: You know what he hath ſaid of all things
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169957:117"/> elſe, that they are <hi>broken Ciſterns.</hi> Ask the Saints alſo, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, take the Angels too; they live in God, and are <hi>confined</hi> in that life, they go no further; yet their <hi>confinement</hi> is no <hi>impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,</hi> but it's a <hi>confinement</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> it's from the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of their Souls. You know that perfect reſt is from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of eſtate. This life, and the wants of it, always breed motion; the ſpirit is ſtill moving out of one condition unto ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better. The conſtant Reſt of thoſe glorified ſpirits in God, is a plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that there is no Life like that. They know the life that we live in this world, they know what honours, pleaſures, and ſuch things are; but they are ſo beneath them, that they do no leſs overlook theſe, then a Prince doth overlook the pooreſt Cottage, or the vileſt things of this world. Nay the Saints on Earth too, when they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do not only prefer a Life in God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, but with contempt of all things: <hi>Paul</hi> puts a note of <hi>ſuperexcellency</hi> upon the knowledg of Chriſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth all things elſe but <hi>droſs and dung, Phil.</hi> 3. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. They <hi>ſuffered the loſs of all things for this life with joyfulneſs;</hi> it did not grieve them to ſee their goods and eſtates taken from them, becauſe they ſaw
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169957:118"/> this loſs make for the further enlargement of their life in God. And thoſe in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>loved not their lives to the death</hi> for Chriſts ſake. When <hi>Solomon</hi> had traverſed all theſe things, (and I make no doubt but he had many that traverſed them with him,) you know what he ſaith of them, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> But why ſhould I dwell upon outward te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies? Make uſe of your own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, give them full ſcope to ſearch, and then think what <hi>proportion</hi> there is between that <hi>life</hi> that is upon things <hi>finite, mixed, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> and of <hi>ſhort continuance,</hi> and that <hi>life</hi> that is in him, that is <hi>infinite,</hi> and <hi>all good, always</hi> the <hi>ſame, abiding</hi> for ever. Deſcend lower then your underſtandings: Call in the ſenſe and experience of thoſe ſeveral ſtates of life which you have paſſed through in the world; as that of <hi>childhood,</hi> of <hi>manhood;</hi> of a <hi>ſingle eſtate,</hi> of a <hi>married eſtate;</hi> of a <hi>meaner</hi> and of a <hi>fuller condition;</hi> take the beſt of them, what did you find in them in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that life that you have in God? Remember all the ſenſe you have had of the ſweetneſs that is in the enjoyment of God, and then upon the verdict of your ſenſe and inward experience, you will find that there is no compariſon between the one and the other. How often have you ſaid, when you
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169957:118"/> have been hunting after and wearied your ſelves in the vanity of this world, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my firſt Husband, for then it was better with me then now? Hoſ.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What a deplorable loſs to our ſpirits is it when we ſuffer a day to paſs without living in God? That day we dye, when as we might have been as they in Heaven. What ſhadows of death have covered your Souls when you have been out of God! What bondage and weight are caſt upon mens ſpirits? how are they as reeds, of no ſtrength, ſhaken with every wind, with the turnings of the things in this world, if their hearts be out of God? We are chargeable with many ſorrows and heart-breakings, and God might put them upon our account; God may viſit us for many of our tears and complaints. What, will not the Fountain give water? will not the full breſt give milk? It is a wrong to ſay ſo of God: We are the cauſe of our own harms and loſſes. The reſt and chearful vigor of a mans Soul is of more worth then a world, and that we loſe whileſt our ſpirits roul up and down. Who can utter what thoſe joys are, what that ſweetneſs of the taſte of the Soul is, which it hath in its ſincere and ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Father of Life, in its ſecret converſings with him, and enjoyment of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169957:119"/> him? What a holy forgetfulneſs of all things hath this wrought? what a holy mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity? what peace paſſing all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? what joy unſpeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? And ſhall we loſe all this by not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our life in God? Our experience and knowledg of theſe things ſhould be as an attractive Load-ſtone, and the ſadneſs of our Souls under the heavy loſs of this ſhould be an enforcement upon us to keep near unto God. The Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.5. gives this as a reaſon why they were ſo weak; <hi>You have forgotten</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation or conſolation that ſpeaks to you as children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Conſideration is, The ſweet and powerful attractions and invitations of the Spirit. How often may that be ſaid to us, which Chriſt ſaith to them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock; if any man will open to me, I will come in and ſup with him?</hi> How often and how ſtrongly hath Wiſdom cryed from Heaven, and uttered her voyce, ſaying, <hi>I have built my houſe, I have prepared my feaſt;</hi> come, my friends, all is prepared for you; come and eat, and rejoyce in the fulneſs of my Love? Chriſt hath followed us, as the <hi>waters followed them in the deſart, mercy and goodneſs hath followed us all our days.</hi> Hath not God by his Spirit
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169957:119"/> urged us from all things, from all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and relations, from every thing that ſtrikes upon our ſenſes, or that comes within the compaſs of our knowledg? As his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is by all things to work us to himſelf; ſo hath he not by all things pleaded with us to come home, and to ſtay at home, that we might be bleſſed in the enjoyment of the ſweetneſs of his preſence? He hath layd up ſomething even in death it ſelf, to bring us to him. A Crown was once found in a thorny buſh. Surely then if God be ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to meet us, and doth ſo ſeek us; if he have ſo richly prepared for us, and ſet things before us; we ſhould provoke our Souls to feed on theſe precious things, and to live that life of the enjoyment of God, which only is Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we <hi>will not</hi> live this life in God, it may be we <hi>ſhall not.</hi> If nothing will prevail, but we will live in the fleſh, and pour out our Souls upon vanities, and will be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in this world, travelling in the deſart, and forſaking the fulneſs and ſweetneſs that is in God; ſurely it may be, that ſhall be our portion all our days: God may, and he doth hide himſelf from the Soul, when the Soul hides it ſelf from him: God calls, and they will not hear; he invites, and they are careleſs: Well, ſaith God, ſeeing they will
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169957:120"/> not come, they ſhall not come; but ſhall live like ſervants and ſtrangers, and ſhall have no more of the Childrens bread then will maintain them in a ſtate of life, but not maintain them in a ſtate of peace. Sorrows and troubles will ſeize upon men, becauſe they would not embrace ſweet mercies. Do you think we can violate all the mercies and goodneſs of God, and be born with? No, no: Remember that example in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>Eli</hi> had many and great manifeſtations of Gods love, but his ſin of fond love to his wicked children, would not be done away with ſacrifice or burnt-offering; God ſaid he would bring evil upon the houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> and he did it.</p>
               <p>As a fundamental aſſiſtance to all this, Look to the ſetling of your Souls in a firm belief of the Goſpel; for ſo far only as we beleeve the words of eternal life, they are of power to us. Remember that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Goſpel came to the Jews, but it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them, becauſe it was not mixed with faith.</hi> The weight of words lies in the truth of them, and not only in the worth of them: For if you ſpeak of mountains of Gold, of heaps of Pearls, though theſe are rich words; yet if there be not as much truth in them, they are but an empty ſound, and take not the heart. Converſe much with all the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169957:120"/> witneſſes of the Scriptures truth, converſe with and call to mind frequently that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Seal which is upon your own ſpirits, that living and effectual force and vertue which the Word of God hath had upon your hearts, unto a thankful embracing of it, to a holy ſubjection to it, to a couragious and chearful dependance upon it, to the melting of your hearts, and the pouring out of your ſpirits unto God. Remember theſe things; for Gods appearances in his Word are as ſo many ſeals and witneſſes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; Reſt not till you can ſay with that Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Theſe are the true ſayings of God:</hi> And with the Apoſtle in <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.2. <hi>We know that his teſtimony is true:</hi> For while this is not done, our comforts and rejoycings in God cannot be high, they cannot exceed our faith.</p>
               <p>Then, let no dark clouds remain upon your ſpirits, ſo far as you can; if you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a little light, make it to encreaſe more and more to the perfect day. Obſerve the language of the people of God, <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives; I know that thou art with me.</hi> How often have you theſe expreſſions in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> 2.3.4. and 5. Chapters; <hi>We know that we are of God; We know that God dwells in us; We know that we have paſſed from death to life; We know that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169957:121"/> we are in the truth?</hi> Endeavor to come to this.</p>
               <p>Again, Be frequent in <hi>drawing comfortable</hi> and <hi>reviving inferences</hi> from your Intereſt in God. Mark what inference the Church makes, <hi>I will wait upon God, my God will hear me. Faith,</hi> and a lively <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God, is full of <hi>argumentation,</hi> and that is the life of the Soul: It is not maintained by a ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God, but by arguments, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſuch concluſions, as are meat and drink indeed to the Soul.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Our Apoſtacy hath made us unapt for divine Life and Converſe with God through a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and willing to conform to the loweſt Patterns.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving ſaid much to this Point, I will ſhew now what great need there is that ſo much ſhould have been ſaid, and much more alſo, for the furtherance of this life in God; take therefore into your hearts theſe few things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We are naturally in greater <hi>affinity</hi> and <hi>capacity</hi> as to the things of the <hi>creature,</hi> then to the things of <hi>God.</hi> It is was not ſo
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:169957:121"/> from the <hi>beginning,</hi> but our <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> caſt us into this unhappy ſtate; that whereas we were neareſt unto God, now all things are nearer unto us then God; we are grown ſtrangers to that life. As the child of a <hi>Prince</hi> that goes away in his childhood, and is trained up in a <hi>beggers</hi> houſe, he contracts a <hi>beggers</hi> ſpirit, and grows a ſtranger to a <hi>Princes</hi> life: So it hath been with us. As <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> lived like a beaſt, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the life of a <hi>Prince,</hi> yea of a <hi>man;</hi> ſo we are ſtrangers from the life of God. What God ſaith in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8.10. is true of us all, <hi>We account his things as ſtrange things,</hi> as things that we are not acquainted with; we have neither a pleaſing ſight of them, nor a pleaſing taſte of them; but they are to us as meat that we cannot reliſh, that ſuits not with us. Nothing was more natural to man then to live in God, as we came out of Gods hand. It was not more natural for the fiſh to live in the water, then for us to live in God; and that was a bleſſed ſtate. The breſt is not more natural to the child, then that life was to us; that was our firſt life, and it was ſweet, though it was ſhort. It was a bleſſed life; for God let out himſelf in ſo much fulneſs, as took the heart up into intimate acquaintance. We were made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that is, ſuch as God delighted in, ſuch
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169957:122"/> as we ſhould be; now we are altered, our ſpirits are divided and ſcattered. In as much then as we have not altogether caſt off our depraved natures, we have need to be thus called upon, we being more enclined to the creature then unto God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Naturally we have a greater propenſity to obſerve the <hi>Law,</hi> then the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;</hi> to <hi>do</hi> what we are <hi>bid,</hi> then to <hi>take</hi> what is <hi>offered and given</hi> to us in the Goſpel: For the Law is natural to us, it is written in our hearts; the things that are revealed in the Goſpel, are above Nature. This diſpoſition the Apoſtle found in thoſe, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 9. latter end, <hi>Iſrael which followed after the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, did not attain unto the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law; for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone.</hi> It was a <hi>ſtumbling ſtone</hi> indeed to them; they rather choſe to make their way to life by the <hi>Law,</hi> then to accept of life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>propoſitions</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law was more near to them, it was more <hi>natural</hi> to them; but the Goſpel is <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> Children are nearer to, and more apt to receive thoſe things which are by Nature, then thoſe things which are by inſtruction and appointment. It is natural for a child to <hi>eat,</hi> he need not be taught it;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169957:122"/> but for a child to <hi>learn,</hi> that is hard, he is at more diſtance from it: So it is more eaſie for us to form our ſelves to the obedience of the <hi>Law,</hi> then to the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are naturally more apt to converſe with God <hi>immediately,</hi> then by a <hi>Mediator:</hi> Becauſe this is ſtill according to the natural courſe and original appointment of God in the firſt Creation of Man. Though then there was a very great <hi>diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi> an infinite <hi>diſproportion</hi> between God and us; yet becauſe there was no Conſcience of guilt, no matter of offence, this poor Creature, though but duſt and aſhes, could come to God, and did converſe with him immediately. But now ſince his going away from God, God hath declared that man ſhould come no more immediately to him, but by the Door which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: He hath made Jeſus Chriſt that Door; and whoſoever entereth by him, hath life, and none elſe. You may knock at the door of Mercy, and ſpend your days in tears and prayers, but not be heard, unleſs your way be through Chriſt: Therefore, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus, <hi>Through Him we beleeve in God.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>He ſaves thoſe that come unto God through Him.</hi> We are very apt rather to come to God as he is the great God, our <hi>Creator,</hi> then to come to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169957:123"/> him through a <hi>Mediator:</hi> Therefore ſince there is no other way of life but this, we had need be taught it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We are apt to think it almoſt <hi>impoſsible</hi> to <hi>live ſuch a life as this.</hi> Oh how do we <hi>greaten</hi> the matter of our <hi>duty!</hi> We make <hi>mountains</hi> of <hi>mole-hills:</hi> The fault is not in <hi>God,</hi> but in <hi>us.</hi> Certainly we might have more: What ſaith the Goſpel? Doth it not call us to <hi>all joy, all peace,</hi> and to <hi>rejoyce always?</hi> What's the meaning of this? Doth not God ſpeak realities? Shall we rather have hard thoughts of God, then of our ſelves? No, no; it is becauſe we <hi>will not,</hi> we <hi>thirſt not:</hi> It is not becauſe water is not to be had, but becauſe we will not take the pains to draw it: We ſay, the Well is deep, and the water will not come; but he hath ſaid, he <hi>will meet thoſe that rejoyce and work righteouſneſs,</hi> and that <hi>he will draw near to thoſe that draw near to him;</hi> and he will be as good as his word. Certainly the fault lies either in our <hi>not ſeeking,</hi> or <hi>not ſeeking as we ſhould,</hi> or in our not taking what is offered to us. Do you not find, that when you come to the door of grace, it ſtands open, and that God is ready to give the comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings of a Father, when you come over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſorrows? Is not he always the ſame? Will he hear one prayer, and not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169957:123"/> another? If you did continue in prayer and ſeeking, might you not have more? It is very ill to fancy ſuch impoſſibilities. Why do you ſet bounds where God hath ſet none? and make that ſo hard to get, which God is ſo willing to give? and ſo ſtraiten your ſelves, when you have licenſe to ask?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We are apt to <hi>live much by pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and examples.</hi> We ſee how Chriſtians live at the common rate; it's neither <hi>night</hi> nor <hi>day</hi> with them; they have a <hi>trembling</hi> hope, a <hi>mingled</hi> joy, a <hi>mourning</hi> life; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>bright,</hi> ſometimes <hi>clouded:</hi> and this ſight doth form other Chriſtians to the ſame life, and makes them ſay, Seeing <hi>others live ſo, I'le live ſo too.</hi> Examples are mighty. Of what force was <hi>Peter</hi>'s example of to the <hi>Galatians</hi> in another caſe? Beggers form one anothers ſpirits to beggery, and a poor kind of life.</p>
               <p>Remember that counſel of the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Be not conform'd unto this world.</hi> Make no <hi>patterns</hi> to your ſelves further then they agree with the <hi>Rule</hi> that you are to go by. How low did the Jews bring themſelves by the traditions of their Fathers? Their Fathers did ſo and ſo: That's a poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly life. Shall I ſay one thing more?</p>
               <p>We are ſubject to <hi>ſlothfulneſs:</hi> It's ſtrange that a Chriſtian ſhould be ſlothful of all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169957:124"/> men. Should we not wonder if we ſaw a man ſlothful to gather up Pearls and Jewels of great worth? Was ever any man ſo ſlothful, that he would not take the pains to eat his meat when he was hungry? Can a poor man be ſo ſlothful, that he will not dig a Myne of Gold when he may have it? What ſhould make a Chriſtian ſlothful? What, is it the <hi>difficulty</hi> of this Life? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if we ſay ſo, we ſpeak evil of God and his goodneſs, as thoſe Spies did of the good Land. What, is there difficulty in eating and drinking? Our way all along is pleaſure; even the pleaſure of living in God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of him. Or is the work <hi>unſucceſsful?</hi> Dare you ſay you have let down your bucket, and drew up nothing? Dare you ſay, that you went ſincerely to God, and could not procure him to hear you? No, you cannot: for when his ſervants have come to him in their worſt conditions, he hath received and embraced them. Could a man come to God in a worſe condition then <hi>David</hi> did? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. When he had run from God deſperately, and ſtayed out a great while, you may well think how often he quenched the ſpirit in that time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with God; and yet when he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and came home, God did not deſpiſe him; God did not ſay to him, Away
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169957:124"/> wretch, what haſt thou to do to expect mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? but pardoned, refreſhed and cheered him; and <hi>David</hi> tells it abroad: <hi>For this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayſt be found.</hi> Say not then with thy ſelf, that thy coming ſhall be unſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>To that which hath been ſaid, we may add theſe pertinent Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we live in God, and fetch all our peace, ſtrength and ſatisfaction from him, we ſhall have the <hi>beſt enjoyment</hi> of <hi>all things elſe:</hi> The taſte of Gods love ſweetens all enjoyments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This puts the Soul into a <hi>ſecure ſtate againſt all dangers;</hi> it cannot be ill with him that enjoys God: It puts a man into a ſtate of <hi>conqueſt and victory</hi> over all things: When a man enjoys God, and lies upon his Love, he is above all things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>fulfils the end of our Creation:</hi> For this was Gods appointment, that we might be for the demonſtration of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Excellency, and to the enhappying of our ſelves in the enjoyment of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This keeps the Soul in <hi>a preparedneſs to all holy walkings and obedience.</hi> When a man lives in God, his heart is tuned to all duties.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Several Queſtions concerning the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Doctrine, anſwered. Saints not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways equally ſtrong. Some afflictions ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened more then others. Sometimes God will have his Rod ſmart.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Proceed now to anſwer two or three Queſtions, which concern this Doctrine and Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Seeing the Saints have this way for Life, and that their Intereſt in God doth ſo ballance their Souls; whence is it that they are ſo frequently dejected, ſo under hatches?</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Queſt.</hi> If Intereſt in God be ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to lift up Chriſtians ſpirits, whence is it that there are ſo many weakneſſes, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and contrarieties to God in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whence is it that they who have no Intereſt in God, oftentimes ſeem to go through very great troubles with much ſtrength?</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Queſt.</hi> If the Saints life ſprings from their Intereſt in God, how is it then that they are ſo often broken in ſpirit, that there dwells with them heavineſs, confuſion and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169957:125"/> diſtraction oftentimes as with others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In the firſt place let us know, that the <hi>Saints do not all live this life equally;</hi> they have not all received ſuch meaſures of grace, that they can with equal magnanimity paſs through their troubles in this world. <hi>Some</hi> paſs through trouble with a <hi>ſpirit of glory,</hi> being highly lifted up above their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: So <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>We glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.</hi> In <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>They ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffered joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 5. when the Apoſtles were <hi>ſcourged, they went away rejoycing, that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus.</hi> Others go not on <hi>triumphantly,</hi> but <hi>ſtedfaſtly;</hi> though their afflictions be not <hi>ſo much under</hi> them, yet they are <hi>above</hi> their afflictions; though they cannot go on their way with ſo <hi>much gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> as others, yet they are <hi>not turned out</hi> of their way. So <hi>Job,</hi> that pattern of patience, was ſometimes up, and ſometimes down; but he had the Conqueſt. It is with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as it is with the Ayr, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bright and ſometimes cloudy, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtormy and ſometimes calm. A Ship at anchor rouls in the Sea, but is ſafe: So Chriſtians have many toſſes in this world, but are ſecure. <hi>Peter</hi> is an inſtance of this truth. And ſome of our own Martyrs and others might be produced, who have ſhewed
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:169957:126"/> a very trembling ſpirit, a miſgiving heart in the time of their tryals. Some have begun to fret at their condition; as that good man <hi>Aſaph</hi> did in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. becauſe he ſaw God did not do for him as for others, was angry, and diſputed the matter. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did ſo in the 12 Chapter of his Book: <hi>Jonah</hi> did ſo with a witneſs: <hi>David</hi> ſometimes, <hi>Why haſt thou forgotten me?</hi> ſaith he. Sometimes they are brought to uſe ill means to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; <hi>Aſa</hi> did ſo in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. Becauſe God did not help him, he would ſee if he could help himſelf; he ſtruck a League with the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this Inequality that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſtians compared one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that is to be found in themſelves at one time compared with themſelves at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, lies in ſuch things as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some</hi> ſufferings are <hi>more ſweetened with the divine preſence</hi> then others: God attends ſome afflictions with <hi>more inward Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>manifeſtations of his Love,</hi> then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thoſe ſufferings that are for his Names ſake, are uſually thus ſweetened. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. ſaith, <hi>If you be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye:</hi> What follows? <hi>For the Spirit of Glory and of God reſts upon you.</hi> Theſe two,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169957:126"/> 
                  <hi>ſufferings</hi> and <hi>rejoycings,</hi> are mixed and put together: In 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>You have received the Goſpel in much affliction, and joy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt:</hi> Much <hi>affliction,</hi> much <hi>perſecution,</hi> and therefore <hi>joy</hi> in the Holy Ghoſt. Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for God and Chriſt, are no bars to the ſweeteſt ſerenity and moſt perfect calm of the Soul; notwithſtanding theſe, joy oft riſes to the higheſt, even unto extaſie; as ſome have found: God uſually pours out himſelf very fully at ſuch times. Light, though but a ſpark, will appear againſt all the darkneſs of a whole ſpacious room; The little light of a twinkling Star, prevails againſt the darkneſs of the night: How much more will the light of Gods face, when that ſhines upon the Soul, prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the darkneſs of ſufferings that are upon a man? When <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were in great afflictions, God ſent his Angel to comfort them. We have examples in our own ſtories, that do ſufficiently witneſs what the ſight and taſte of divine Love will do in ſufferings: Have not ſome called the <hi>flames beds</hi> of <hi>Roſes?</hi> not only things <hi>without pain,</hi> but of <hi>pleaſure? Euſebius</hi> tells of one that writ to his friend from a <hi>ſtinking Dungeon,</hi> and dated his Letter, from my <hi>delicate Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi> God ſo ſweetens every condition, even the worſt that they undergo for his ſake,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169957:127"/> that they have more contentment and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Soul, then a Prince on his Throne. Therefore the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. hath theſe expreſſions, <hi>Great is my boldneſs of ſpeech to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you, great is my glorying of you, I am fill'd with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulations.</hi> Strange matter of Joy! He was very glad to hear that they were <hi>hunted</hi> and <hi>perſecuted</hi> of this world for the Name of Chriſt, as himſelf was; becauſe now he knew they ſhould enjoy more of God, and of that which the world knew not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Account it all joy when you fall into ſuch temptations,</hi> when you ſuffer thus. Other afflictions and tryals uſually have leſs of ſweetneſs in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>True Intereſt in God, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of equal ſtrength and power with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Let a man be ſuppoſed to be of a vaſt eſtate (ſuch things have been found,) if he doth not keep an exact account of what he hath, he may think himſelf worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and then will be as a Begger, though he be rich: So a Chriſtian not keeping the account of his Intereſt clear, may ſuffer in his Spirit as one that is without God, when indeed he is in the boſom of God. Oh how is our unhappy ſpirit ſubject to excurſions and wanderings from God! and theſe are the deſtruction of our peace, and bring our
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:169957:127"/> Souls into a night of ſorrow. <hi>Aſah</hi> (of whom I ſpake before) was out upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe he had loſt the ſweetneſs of the enjoyment of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>God ſometimes leaves his people, not only to their ſufferings, but to grief,</hi> yea <hi>and to faintings under their burdens.</hi> When God comes in way of <hi>Correction,</hi> he will have his <hi>Rod known</hi> to be a <hi>Rod,</hi> it ſhall ſmart. It is true, the ultimate end of it, is to make us more partakers of his holineſs; His end is cure, but the way is by grief, and we ſhall know the weight of his hand when he comes thus: When God comes to viſit us, it will be a ſharp ſeaſon. He will not always deny us ſome comfort from the manifeſtation of himſelf to us; but he will ſo manage the matter, that we ſhall know he is not pleaſed with us. But however, there is a vaſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the people of God, and others; between their impatience under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and that of the world; for God doth maintain his preſence in his people, and they find it; it's attended with ſuch a Spirit as this, uſually in the worſt times they can ſtill plead with God. You have an example in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17. <hi>All this is come upon us; yet we have not forgot Thee, nor dealt falſly in thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Our hearts have not turned back, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have our ſteps declined from thy Way:</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:169957:128"/> And yet they had complained very much in the words before, and ſhewed a deep ſenſe of the burdens and troubles that lay upon their ſpirits; yet for all this God was their God, and they had not departed from him. So in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.8. <hi>In the way of thy Judgments, O Lord, we have waited for Thee; the deſire of our Soul is to thy Name, and to the remembrance of it.</hi> This is the frame of the ſpirit of Gods people, that although they complain and be full of ſorrows, yet ſtill their affections are towards God; they are unmoveable and unchangeable; <hi>our deſires are ſtill towards Thee.</hi> You know that famous ſpeech of <hi>Job</hi> in Chap. 13.15. <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him;</hi> and yet <hi>Job</hi> ſpoke many hard things, and was full of bitterneſs. And the Church here in this <hi>Micah</hi> 7. ſaith, <hi>She will wait, and bear the indignation of the Lord,</hi> which was heavy upon her, till God came and ſhewed mercy to her.</p>
               <p>Again, Though they are born down, they riſe again; all the hurt of their ſpirits ends in a ſweet recovery. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. it is ſaid concerning <hi>Ephraim, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed; I was as a Bullock unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the yoke:</hi> See what a carriage here was; he was ſmitten and ſmitten, but ſtill ſtout and unquiet, reſtleſs and kicking againſt the Rod; but afterward he ſaith,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169957:128"/> 
                  <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned;</hi> though there was before a froward ſpirit, there is now a praying ſpirit, that he might be brought unto himſelf; <hi>I was aſhamed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and confounded, becauſe I did bear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of my youth.</hi> The return of Saints is with this double excellency.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With a <hi>deep ſelf-abhorrency</hi> when they find they have fainted in the day of their tryal; when they reflect upon the ill carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of their ſpirits toward God, there is a deep ſhame falls upon them. <hi>Job</hi> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Chap. 42. when he ſaw God, and remembered his own carriage, he ſaith, <hi>I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes, [in duſt and aſhes,]</hi> that is, he was very much afflicted; for that was the manner of the afflicted, as you may read in <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. <hi>Oh daughter of my people, gird thee with ſackcloth, and Wallow in Aſhes:</hi> So in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61. <hi>I will give them beauty for Aſhes;</hi> that is, in ſtead of a <hi>mourning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> I will put them into a <hi>joyful.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. that good man confeſſeth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, <hi>I was fooliſh and ignorant, even as a beaſt before Thee;</hi> my carriage was brutiſh and abſurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They attain alſo <hi>more ſubjection unto God</hi> then before, they have their <hi>hearts more bowed</hi> to him then before: Diſcoveries of ſin, and reſtored mercies, do mightily work
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:169957:129"/> upon their ſpirits. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. <hi>David</hi> after his diſ-reſt yielded to God, and came to more calmneſs of ſpirit; <hi>I held my peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was thy doing.</hi> The Lord will not loſe his people; his end when he comes to ſmite them, is not to drive them from him: They can ſay to God, as he ſaid to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when he was driving him from ſchool with a ſtaff, <hi>It's not thy ſtaff can drive me from thee.</hi> What father ever uſed the rod upon his child, that he might alienate the heart of his child from him? Nay, if a father had power to bring the ſpirit of his child to his own heart, he would do it: God can, and therefore he will. It cannot ſtand with that infinite goodneſs which is in God, by afflictions, or any thing elſe, to ſeparate his people from himſelf, he having ſet his own Image upon them: What, would he give the blood of his own Son for them, and ſuffer them to be thrown away? No, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he ſuffer them to throw themſelves away.</p>

                  <p>How it comes to paſs that deformities creep into the Converſation of Chriſtians, ſince they have ſo high a principle of life. Whence it is that thoſe which enjoy not God, ſeem to go through afflictions with ſtrength.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Second Queſtion is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> If Intereſt in God be ſo effectual to lift up Chriſtians ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whence is it that there is ſuch a poor ragged ſpirit appearing in ſome Chriſtians, and that ſo many weakneſſes and frailties are upon them? that ſo much of contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God and deformity is ſometimes in their carriage?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is a moſt deplorable Truth, and to be lamented of all the generation of the righteous, That very few of thoſe that beleeve, do enjoy a clear and conſtant ſight of their Intereſt in God. Many do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring a damp upon it by their going out from him, they dwell not in him and the hope of glory; for the nature of that is to ſanctifie and bring us into a conformity to God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf as he is pure:</hi> And, <hi>Whoſoever abideth in him, ſinneth not:</hi> So far as a mans abiding is in God, ſo far he is at
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169957:130"/> a greater diſtance from ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is ſomething in the natural temper (I may call it rather unnatural) that very much clouds the beauty of a Chriſtians Converſation. Some things will be in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians according to that ſtate of the body which they have here: Let a man be <hi>ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed</hi> to <hi>anger, fear, grief,</hi> or <hi>ſorrow,</hi> theſe paſſions will oftentimes appear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in the conſtitution of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and grace is not ſo perfect a Phyſician as to alter the ſtate of it: The end of grace is to bring the worſer part into conformity and obedience, and it will do it at laſt; and in the mean time, where it cannot <hi>govern,</hi> it will <hi>cry out</hi> and <hi>complain,</hi> as the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In great <hi>tryals the ſpirits of men are apt to be more ſerious, ſolid and contracted, then in ſmaller matters.</hi> A Soldier gathers up his courage, puts on his armor, and will ſtand to it, when he is aſſaulted for his life; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he minds not the little dog that bites him by the heels. Great ſpirits oftentimes are mov'd at ſmall things, that are not mov'd at all at greater things. <hi>Aaron</hi> was ſometime ſtir'd at a leſs occaſion; yet when that ſore tryal was upon him, mentioned in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>Aaron held his peace:</hi> He had a plain ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Mind and Will of God
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169957:130"/> in the thing, and he was quiet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Aſſaults upon our outward man are more viſible then corruptions that dwell in us:</hi> Sin comes oftentimes ſtealing and creeping by degrees: ſo it did upon <hi>Solomon;</hi> though he was a wiſe man, yet he was not aware whether he was going.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Afflictions and ſufferings being things without us, corruptions and ſins within us, it's eaſier for us to bear one then the other.</hi> A Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant can bear a burden upon his ſhoulders, but is not able to bear a little ſtone in his bladder. The Earth that is not moved by all the ſtorms without, is ſhaken with a little wind in the body of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Outward ſufferings and tryals uſually are more conſiſtent and abiding; but miſcarriages, obliquities and deformities are tranſient things, more ſudden, and ſo ſurprize us.</hi>

In <hi>Saul</hi> evil wrought like it ſelf: The natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of affliction is depravation. Affliction
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169957:131"/> ſtirs up, and puts life and activity into ſin: as when you beat a Wolf, you make him more a Wolf then he was before. In 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28.22. it's ſaid of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that <hi>in the time of his affliction he did add to ſin againſt God;</hi> he <hi>ſin'd more and more: This is that Ahaz;</hi> or as ſome read, <hi>This is Ahaz the King, the ſame.</hi> A like phraſe you have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.23. <hi>Thou art the ſame. Saul</hi> fretted and was angry; his Soul was at diſ-reſt, and in a rage within him, becauſe he was croſs'd, and ſuffered a fruſtration of his hopes and deſigns. This is the natural operation of evil upon ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; as the Wiſe-man hath it in <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.3. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord;</hi> he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his condition, and, in that, with God. But ſee <hi>Davids</hi> carriage in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. <hi>I layd mine hand upon my mouth, I held my peace, becauſe it was Thou, O Lord, that didſt it.</hi> It was a patience not <hi>conſtrained,</hi> but from <hi>ſatisfaction of ſpirit;</hi> he ſaw love in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and that ſweetened his Soul. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that in very faithfulneſs thou haſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me, Pſal.</hi> 119.17. <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> is a <hi>reach</hi> beyond <hi>Juſtice,</hi> there is ſomething more of ſweetneſs in it, and that <hi>David</hi> ſaw. <hi>Saul</hi> went out and did not keep his way, but <hi>David</hi> made ſtreight ſteps unto his feet. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21. he gives an account of himſelf;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169957:131"/> 
                  <hi>I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God;</hi> or, <hi>I have not done wickedly from God;</hi> or, as the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, <hi>I have not walked in my wickedneſs from God; for all his Judgments were before me, and I did not put away his Statutes from me:</hi> they were before me, in mine eye, for obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; before me, in mine heart, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and contentment, and I did not turn my back upon them; or as it is in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.23. <hi>I turned not away from them:</hi> ſo is the expreſſion there; <hi>I was alſo upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> or <hi>with him,</hi> or <hi>I was perfect to him, I was upright to him;</hi> all the while I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſufferings, my wiſhes, mine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, my intentions were unmoveable, they were ſtill toward God, I did not change in my ſpirit toward God, though he made me to know many changes in my condition; I was tempted to impatience and revenge, but I kept my ſelf from mine evil diſpoſitions and workings; I bridled my ſpirit, and ſo preſerved my ſelf in his ways.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, Take the moſt noble and generous ſpirit in the world, that hath not attained to an enjoyment of God, and you ſhall find that it is far beneath that ſpirit which a ſight of Intereſt in God works in his people. Look upon the <hi>ſtrength</hi> that ſuch a man may poſſibly have, it is either
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:169957:132"/> from <hi>meer Reaſon,</hi> whereby he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf to patience by the neceſſity and mutability of things, &amp;c. but this can never lead him into thoſe depths, whereby he ſhall be filled with thoſe joys and comforts which the ſight of Intereſt in God fills the Soul withall: Or it may be from <hi>natural courage;</hi> and every man hath ſomething of this, and many beaſts have more then men: <hi>Job</hi> hath told us of the courage of the Horſe in <hi>Job</hi> 39.20. <hi>Canſt thou make him afraid as the graſhopper?</hi> And in Chap. 41.33. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Leviathan, he ſaith, that <hi>upon the Earth there is not his like, which is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear; he beholdeth all high things,—he is a king over all the children of pride.</hi> But there is often an addition to this natural courage in men from pride both againſt God and men, and by an influence from this world that ſtrengthens them in their ſufferings and hardſhips. But ſee a little further the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why many times thoſe men carry it out ſo ſtoutly; they do not underſtand the <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy</hi> and <hi>import</hi> of their ſufferings, as the people of God do: It is true, God intends more evil unſpeakably in the ſufferings of the one, then of the other; but one hath a hint of it, more then the other: The Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever underſtands it not, receives not the meſſage into his judgment, he conceives not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169957:132"/> that theſe are tokens of the diſpleaſure and anger of God againſt him; but the ſight of the diſpleaſure of God to a good man is more then any Rod.</p>
               <p>Once more, No wonder that they bear ſo ſtrongly, for it is their Judgment: God pours out a ſpirit of <hi>ſtupidity and ſenſleſſneſs, a ſpirit of hardneſs</hi> upon them; as you have it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. <hi>He pours on them the ſpirit of ſlumber:</hi> The word properly ſignifies <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,</hi> or <hi>remorſe;</hi> but ſo it reaches not to the Hebrew Text, for the words in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew are in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.10. <hi>He poured on them the ſpirit of deep ſleep.</hi> Some therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee the Hebrew doth ſpeak this, have made the Greek word to ſpeak in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence then it is tranſlated; they read it <hi>the night,</hi> and ſo make this ſpirit of <hi>com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>unc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be the ſpirit of <hi>the night:</hi> However that may be ſomething ſtrained, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the word muſt anſwer to the Hebrew, and that is a <hi>ſpirit of deep ſleep.</hi> Now as a man that is aſleep hath not a ſenſe of things, ſo it is with theſe men. The Apoſtle uſeth another expreſſion in the words before in verſ. 7. of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>The reſt were hardened.</hi> It was with them as it is with a man that hath a thick skin drawn over him, that hath a part of his fleſh become brawny, he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſenſe of things; no more can theſe:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:169957:133"/> therefore it is no wonder they bear their ſufferings ſo ſtoutly as they do; it is their Judgment.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Compariſon of Intereſt and Enjoyment, and the excellency of Enjoyment evinced from Intereſt. What is requiſite to make full En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. An affectionate Cloſe to all the foregoing Diſcourſes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Will ſhut up this Diſcourſe by drawing one Inference from what hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. The Inference is this, If Intereſt in God be ſo ſweet, ſo powerful and mighty, how precious and excellent is the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? For that take theſe few Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To have <hi>an Intereſt in God, is much leſs then to enjoy God.</hi> A great difference there is between the meaneſt Saint and a glorified Spirit; and yet the meaneſt Saint hath as well an Intereſt in God, as the higheſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Glory. Intereſt in all things is leſs then poſſeſſion. An heir hath not ſo much ſweetneſs and content in his right and title, as when he comes to have actual poſſeſſion of that he looks for. A ſtate of meer Intereſt
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169957:133"/> is a ſtate of expectation; and where there is hope, there is always grief: it's a ſtate of deſire, and that imports want; for when there is fulneſs, deſire ceaſeth. Therefore you find this to be the temper of the people of God, that having ſeen their Intereſt, they long after enjoyment. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>We ſigh and groan,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (and he heaps one word upon another) <hi>till we come</hi> to the fulneſs of that which we have Intereſt in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider this, That <hi>though Intereſt here be not without ſome enjoyment of God, yet that enjoyment is far leſs then it will be.</hi> There be four things that make up en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A gracious preſence, a ſweet effuſion or communication of himſelf to the Soul.</hi> It muſt not be a bare preſence, but an active pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; God pouring forth himſelf. A Child that hath the breſt, doth not enjoy it, when he cannot draw the milk. A Garden is not enjoyed by him whoſe it is, that hath neither flowers nor fruits from it. That which we have of God here, though it be more then we had reaſon to look for, and is that which the Angels wonder at; yet it is very little to that which we look for in Heaven; it's called the <hi>firſt fruits:</hi> it is but the <hi>infancy</hi> of that bleſſed ſtate whereto we are adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All the enjoyment we have of God in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169957:134"/> this world is not effectual to the removing of its contrary, that is, to caſt out all fear and heavineſs, all ſorrow and dejection out of the mind. That enjoyment of God which Chriſt himſelf had here on Earth did not keep out all fear and ſorrow. Fulneſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing is, <hi>A mind enlightened and enabled to a juſt comprehenſion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God, and of the ſweetneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and love of God.</hi> By <hi>comprehenſive,</hi> I mean as much as the faculty can reach and extend unto. But now the mind cannot have an obſervation of all the emanations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love; more then a Child can count the drops of milk which it ſucks: We may as well tell the drops of rain in a ſhowre, as tell the particulars of the love of God pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth upon us: Our minds cannot extend to a juſt comprehenſion of that ſweetneſs and love that is in God. It is with us as 'tis with a child that hath a Jewel put into his hand of exceeding great value for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, and of greater worth for the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, being the Seal of a Crown to him, but the child knows it not: So the mercies of God are more in their nature and in their end then we can comprehend, they are far above our reach. Our minds are ſo ſtraiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we cannot have a full enjoyment of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169957:134"/> God here; but if in this life we find ſo much ſweetneſs in what we do enjoy, what will it be when our Light ſhall be like the Sun at noon-day?</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is requiſite <hi>a lively ſenſe of the preſence of God.</hi> The Soul hath its ſenſe as well as the body; nay more, for it's the fountain of ſenſe to the body. In <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. the Apoſtle prays, that <hi>they may abound in all knowledg and ſenſe of the things of God.</hi> As the body receives its life from things by the ſenſes, ſo doth the Soul alſo receive its life in the ſweetneſs and comfort of the preſence of God by its ſpiritual ſenſe. Take away ſenſe, and a man is as a dead thing, and all things are dead to him; and the preſence of God would be a dead thing to the Soul, if it were not for the Souls ſenſe of it; I mean the ſpiritual ſenſe, which the Church ſpeaks of, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſat under his ſhadow, and his fruit was pleaſant to my taſte.</hi> But now the ſenſe of the Soul hath here a dulneſs upon it, it's ſhort of that quickneſs to which it was appointed; therefore we cannot have that full enjoyment of God here, as hereafter. But if what we do enjoy now be ſo ſweet, what will the enjoyment be, when the Soul ſhall be ſo full of ſenſe?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A perfect love of God is required to a full enjoyment of God.</hi> Love muſt be in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169957:135"/> height and heat, if the Soul have a compleat and full enjoyment of God. Take two perſons never ſo qualified and furniſhed to make the life of both comfortable, if there be not love, there cannot be a happy enjoyment of theſe two. As a man loves a thing, ſo he enjoys it when he hath it: So, as a man loves God, ſo he will cleave to him, and pour out himſelf in a bleſſed frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him: As our love is, ſo is our life and enjoyment. Though our enjoyment of God here be imperfect and weak, yet it's of that ſtrength, that it conquers and bears up the heart againſt all afflictions whatſoever: Therefore there muſt needs be a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſweetneſs in the fulneſs of this Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third Conſideration is this; Let our enjoyment here be what it will, it is mixt with many ſorrows, many wants, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtraits, both within and without: our life is ſuch here, that our afflictions many times ſeem to out-weigh our enjoyments; they ſtrike quick upon the ſenſe, and come too near the ſpirit: Hence it is that you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find good men complain more of one affliction, then they mention a thouſand mercies. Our life here is mix'd: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>You have received the Word with much afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with joy;</hi> they are <hi>mingled.</hi> Now I
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169957:135"/> ſay, If the Conſolations of God from that little enjoyment of him here in the midſt of many ſufferings be ſo ſweet and precious, that it bears the Soul up above all; what then will the full enjoyment of God be in that Land of Reſt, where is light and no darkneſs, life and no death, all good and no evil?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The enjoyment of God here is ſubject to many interruptions.</hi> Sometimes by our <hi>ſinful diverſions</hi> from God, the Soul goes out from the boſom of the Father, minding other things, and ſo our hearts are taken and brought into an eſtrangedneſs from God, to a poor kind of delight in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. <hi>As a bird that wanders from her neſt, ſo is a man that is out of his place, Prov.</hi> 27.8. Surely a man is never more out of his place, then when he goes out from God; and then he is like a bird that is gone from her neſt; ſhe knows not where to reſt, but is troubled to find the way home again, and to recover the loſs that ſhe hath brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſelf by her fooliſh wandering.</p>
               <p>Sometimes there is an interruption by the <hi>appointment</hi> of God. God will not always have you lie at the breſts of Conſolation; nay, ſaith God, when his people are ſitting by the Well of the Water of Life, This muſt not be all your work, I'le have you
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169957:136"/> about <hi>this</hi> buſineſs, and <hi>that</hi> employment: Now theſe interruptions do leſſen our life and our happineſs; but the time will come when we ſhall always live in the preſence of our Father, and our minds ſhall be encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with nothing elſe, but we ſhall be filled and bleſſed with the viſion of God.</p>
               <p>Sometimes this interruption is <hi>cauſed by Gods going out from us;</hi> there be receſſes and retreats of God; he ſometimes out of his wiſdom ſhadows his love and favour: but in Heaven there will be always a full, viſible and clear preſence.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The <hi>enjoyment of God muſt needs be ſweet, becauſe it is ſuch as fills the whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Soul;</hi> and <hi>when there is fulneſs, there is reſt.</hi> When a man hath what he can wiſh, he can go no further. <hi>At thy right hand are Rivers of pleaſure, and in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16. <hi>ult.</hi> The Apoſtle in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.28. ſomething alters the expreſſion that is uſed in the Pſalms, <hi>Thou haſt made me glad with thy Countenance.</hi> The ſenſe of the good preſence and favour and love of God, doth fill the Soul with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and when it can hold no more, it hath enough.</p>
               <p>Let the iſſue of all this Diſcourſe be to ſet our hearts a longing and wiſhing, O that I were bleſſed with a full enjoyment of God!
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:169957:136"/> O that I had as much of him as ever I ſhall or can have! The Soul that is thus in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, travels without pain. The Mind reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after other things, oftentimes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretcheth it ſelf: There are uſually, if not always, pains with deſires, eſpecially in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after the Creature, becauſe that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is a fruſtration of our deſires, or an elongation of the things, the things are far off, hard to come by; our deſires often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are mute, they ſpeak not; or the things that we deſire, know not our minds: but our deſires after God always ſpeak, they are open unto God, he heareth their voyce. <hi>All my deſires are before Thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 38.8. <hi>and my groanings are not hid from Thee.</hi> Therfore it muſt needs be ſweet, when the Soul lies thus open unto God. Other deſires do not aſſure and ſecure a man in the things he deſires; a man may wiſh this, and wiſh that, and go without both: but the Soul that thus longs after God, is inſtated in his wiſh, hath a preſent enjoyment, and certainly ſhall have a full enjoyment of him. <hi>He will fulfil the deſire of them that fear him, God will hear them,</hi> Pſal. 145.16. They that long moſt, receive moſt; it's the hungry ſpirit that feeds beſt, and fares beſt. When the Church was ſick of love, being very much taken with what ſhe had, and much
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169957:137"/> longing after what ſhe wanted; then ſhe could ſay, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine, his deſire is towards me,</hi> in <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.10. That refreſhed her; the Greek reads it, <hi>his Converſion is towards me;</hi> indeed God will turn to thoſe that go out toward him: In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.5. <hi>He meets thoſe that work righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſeek him in his ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Conſider this, <hi>That longing after a full enjoyment is the natural effect of a known Intereſt in God.</hi> Look through all the Orders of the Creation, and you ſhall find that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſeeks the enjoyment of its Intereſt; <hi>Angels</hi> do, <hi>Men</hi> do, <hi>Beaſts</hi> do, they ſeek their own, their own paſtures, their own young, their own mates. Can you imagine that we ſhould be the Children of God, and account him our Father, and not long to enjoy him? A child hears from his father, and receives tokens from his father, but he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, he would be with his father: So it is truly with a Child of God; ſo far as he hath received of that Spirit, he longs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God. Intereſt in God works by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of its own, and God works in it too: God purſues his Intereſt in us to the utmoſt; therefore he is working us to himſelf by all means, all ways, by good and evil, by life, by mortality and death, by the ſenſes, by Ordinances, by his Spirit; He is always at
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:169957:137"/> work to bring us home, that we may be in his poſſeſſion, and enjoy him. And to make it the more full, he hath appointed the breaking of theſe bodies, that our ſpirits may come more full to him; nay, and he hath appointed a day of Reſurrection, that our bodies may come full to him; and this is one great end of Chriſts coming again, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>that we may be with him in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe.</hi> If God ſo drives on his Intereſt to make us perfect with him, let us drive on our Intereſt to make God fully ours in the enjoyment of him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is nothing to hinder in this Caſe,</hi> that you ſhould not drive on to a full and perfect enjoyment of him. Are you full in this world? ſhould your full enjoyments of the world hinder your full enjoyments of God? Is not God better then theſe things? Are you ſcanted in this world? The more need you have then of the fulleſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. Have you much of God? You know the more what God is, and can you chuſe but deſire him? Have you little of God? Then you need more, and ſhould drive on to get more. Are you ſure of your Intereſt? Where Intereſt is moſt ſure, there is moſt love; and where the Soul loves moſt, thither it drives moſt. Do you fear your Intereſt? You have ſo much the more
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169957:138"/> reaſon to ſeek after a full enjoyment of God to the ſatisfaction of your Souls. What do you think ſhould ſtand in the way? You muſt part with the world; What is this world to your Fathers houſe, and to God himſelf? You muſt dye; What is death? Cannot that everlaſting life recompence you infinitely? Therefore there is nothing to hinder you. Then ſeeing God invites you and provokes you to ſeek more of him in this world, though you cannot have all, <hi>I conjure you by all the ſweetneſs that is in God, and that you have found in God,</hi> that you obey his Word herein, and drive on more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and ſtrongly to a more full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>

                  <p>Gods Intereſt in man <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>acquired;</hi> this latter twofold. Of holy Reſignation. Of true and falſe Mourning.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have choſen this excellent Pattern (to propoſe to you and to my ſelf) of an ingenuous ſpirit. <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, would be ſaved, but not after the manner of the men of this world, that would be ſaved to be their own, and to enjoy themſelves at their own wills; but he in being ſaved would be Gods, and at his diſpoſing; <hi>I am thine, ſave me.</hi> There are three things here that would be thought on.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:169957:139"/>1. What <hi>David</hi> means when he ſaith, <hi>I am thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What the Reaſon ſhould be that we ſhould uſe ſuch an acknowledgment of our ſelves to be Gods when we pray to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What force there is in this argument to be pleaded with God, <hi>I am thine, ſave me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thine]</hi> We are ſaid to be Gods, either by way of <hi>affection,</hi> as the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>I am my well-beloveds, and my well-beloved is mine:</hi> Or in reſpect of that <hi>Intereſt that God hath in us.</hi> The Intereſt of God in man is upon a twofold Foundation and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon account of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> the natural Law, which doth ſet God as Lord over all, and acknowledg him ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Commander of every thing, becauſe he is the Original and glorious Fountain of all Being. Upon that account it is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.11. it is ſaid, <hi>The Heavens are thine, and the Earth alſo is thine; as for the world and the fulneſs thereof, thou haſt founded them.</hi> There is the ground of that <hi>Dominion</hi> which God hath over all things; they are his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, things that himſelf hath made. And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.12. God owns himſelf in this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty; <hi>The Heavens are mine, and the Earth is mine, and all that in them is.</hi> To be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169957:139"/> able no otherwiſe to ſay, <hi>I am thine,</hi> is but ſad. In a family, the meaneſt things that are ſcarce fit to be retained in the houſe, are his to whom the houſe belongs: All things are Gods, even the meaneſt creatures; and to have no other relation to God then this, is but to be in the condition of things moſt contemptible. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.14. God ſpeaks of a better relation to his people; <hi>Behold, the Heavens, and the Heaven of Heavens is the Lord thy Gods, the Earth alſo with all that therein is: Now the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and choſe his ſeed after them, even you above all people, as appeareth this day.</hi> We muſt be his upon a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count then that of Creation.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecond Intereſt that God hath in man, and that is <hi>acquired;</hi> and that partly by <hi>Redemption,</hi> God having redeemed both by price and power a certain number to himſelf out of the lump of mankind; theſe in an eſpecial manner are his. So <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and formed thee, O Iſrael, Fear not, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee, I have called thee by name, thou art mine. [I have redeemed thee,]</hi> that is, I have delivered thee from the great power of the mighty Ones that bare Rule over thee, and under whom thou ſufferedſt hard things: Therefore thou art mine. This
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169957:140"/> we know is a Law that is amongſt men, That thoſe that are conquered, and ſaved from the ſword, become his by whom they are ſo ſubdued.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecond acquired Intereſt that God hath in man, and that is by <hi>Contract;</hi> wherein man engageth himſelf to a <hi>reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of himſelf to God: In which ſence <hi>David</hi> ſpake alſo, when he ſaid, <hi>I am thine.</hi> The <hi>Contract</hi> between God and man, which is the foundation of this <hi>Intereſt,</hi> is <hi>a mutual engaging to be each others, according to their capacities.</hi> I'le not inſiſt upon opening this deſcription, but will a little hint at ſome of thoſe ſtrange things that are in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between God and man: And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A word as to Gods part. It's a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract where there is the greateſt diſparity that is imaginable between the two parties: For here is he that is the higheſt, and the other party that is lower then the loweſt and meaneſt creature, more contemptible then the worm. Princes do not make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts with beggers, and yet they may have need of ſuch, though not for their aſſiſtance, yet as theaters to diſplay their bounty and goodneſs on. God needs not the whole Creation to ſet forth his glory, who is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in himſelf, God al ſufficient.</p>
               <p>To this add that diſparity that is between
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169957:140"/> the things which God requires of man, and the things which God engageth himſelf to do for man. Was there ever ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract made? Saith God, Do you but your part, which is not a thouſand part of what is due, and I'le do my part; What is that? More then he did at firſt indent for; I'le give you an eternal, immutable life, and that in my own Preſence and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>You may caſt your eyes from that again, and wonder more at the Mediator, by whom and through whom this Covenant, this Contract was made: God ſends his own Son into the world, both to beſpeak man to be willing to enter into this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and to ſeal up the Contract with his own blood.</p>
               <p>That part which concerns man, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning of himſelf unto God, which is an abſolute parting with himſelf, and putting himſelf everlaſtingly under the power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſoveraignty of God, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ordered and diſpoſed in all things by him according to his Will. I ſhall now ſet before you certain peculiar things that are proper to this engagement of man, and reſignation of himſelf unto God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſigning of our ſelves to God, there is an act ſpringing from the <hi>greateſt neceſsity,</hi> and wherein there is the <hi>greateſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:169957:141"/> and <hi>freedom</hi> of ſpirit. It was ill done to put theſe two into a contrariety and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>Neceſsity</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> which do moſt perfectly agree: By how much the more any creature is excellent, by ſo much the more he is neceſſarily what he is, and yet moſt freely ſuch. The Angels love God neceſſarily, and yet moſt freely: Nay God himſelf is good moſt neceſſarily, and yet is ſo, and doth good moſt freely.</p>
               <p>This might be manifeſted in ſundry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, where there is ſome degree of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and alſo a very excellent freedom and willingneſs. As for example; Take two friends fully ſuited to each other, their hearts are neceſſarily carried to mutual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and yet moſt freely. It is in this caſe as in flying from evil; a man flies from evil by a kind of enforcement, and yet freely, eſpecially from ſome great evil; when he ſees there is a neceſſity to fly, he cannot but fly, and yet doth it freely.</p>
               <p>In reſigning of our ſelves to God, that which is the fundamental reaſon of it, lays upon the Spirit of a man a ſtrong neceſſity, and yet leaves that ſpirit in a very ſweet and excellent freedome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.10. You have both theſe expreſt, <hi>Thy people ſhal be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> in the day when thou puteſt forth thy power, who wilt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169957:141"/> rule in the midſt of thine enemies, and raiſe up to thy ſelf a Kingdome not onely among ſtrangers, but Rebels; in this day of thy power thy people ſhal be <hi>willing,</hi> yea <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, very willing:</hi> they ſhall come to thee, with all earneſtneſs. The will of a man may truly and in good fence be ſubject to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and yet not limited in its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it may be compel'd; how? Not by meer phyſicall power acting upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man, but by a <hi>moral</hi> power, by force of Arguments and Reaſons propoſed, and ſet on the ſoul; ſo <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd him to eat bread,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. And they were ſent to command <hi>and to compell them to come to the Feaſt.</hi> Indeed this inforcing and commanding reaſon is the great inſtrument of the power of God, whereby he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the ſpirits of thoſe whom he loves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obedience to himſelf. This is the key that opens the heart, as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. <hi>God opened the heart of Lydia.</hi> Reſignation of a mans ſelf to God is from the efficacie of Gods mighty appearance and manifeſtation of himſelf to the ſoul of a man, by which he is over powr'd and cannot deny God; but notwithſtanding this neceſſity he doth moſt freely fall under the power that acts upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing concerning Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169957:142"/> is, <hi>that Self is ſaved by being deſtroyed,</hi> it <hi>lives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y death;</hi> A man finds himſelf by loſing himſelf, and doth beſt enjoy himſelf by parting with himſelf. There is a great miſtake, and it is the faſcination and witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the powers of darkneſs upon the ſpirits of men, that by Nature (corrupt nature) we are apt to think, that the giving of our ſelves to God, is the giving of our ſelves away to our loſs; whereas it is our making; it's not the ſtraitning, but the perfecting of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take it in this Similitude. A poor woman that lives in rags, hath the honor and happineſs of being wife to a great Prince offered her; for her now to give up her ſelf, is no way to ſtraiten her freedom, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh her happineſs; for ſhe will enjoy her ſelf better as a Queen, then as a Begger. So by reſigning our ſelves unto God, we loſe no liberty, nor any thing that is good; but enjoy our ſelves in greater amplitude and fulneſs of all happineſs. So that for a man to give himſelf to God, is ſelf-love in the height of it, and there is no true ſelf-love but this: for a man to think to love himſelf in ways of ſeparation from God, or in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to God, is to hate himſelf, in the appearance of love; but this is true ſelf-love, that makes me give my ſelf to God, and be ſubject to him.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:169957:142"/>3. Reſigning of our ſelves to God is an act of the <hi>greateſt joy,</hi> and the <hi>greateſt grief.</hi> Of the greateſt <hi>joy</hi> and contentment; for when once the Soul is bleſt with ſuch a life from above, as over-powers a man, and makes him ſurrender himſelf to God, now he is in his firſt and proper Center. The whole ſtate of men out of God, is nothing but a conſtant courſe of confuſion, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs motion; who by reaſon of darkneſs and want of judgment, by reaſon of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and want of ſenſe, may think they are well, may think they are at home, when they are not; but are like men fallen aſleep in a ſtrange place; ſo is every man that is out of God. But when the heart is brought home to God, it is in its place. Do you think the Prodigal had not more reſt in his Fathers houſe, then among the Swine? Now a man ſees what a bleſſed change is wrought in his condition, that he is come now into a ſtate of Reconciliation with God, and of unſpeakable advancement of his nature; that he is advanced to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt freedom, to the greateſt honor and riches, to the beſt life every way; and ſo this Reſignation is an act of the greateſt Joy.</p>
               <p>It's likewiſe ſuch a work as is with the greateſt grief. Theſe two will ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169957:143"/> neither can they be parted; every mans grief is as his joy is. Conſider theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That when a man is brought to God, he is put into a ſtate of Judgment and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity; ſo that now he ſees things as they are, and looks upon the wrongs he hath done againſt God with another eye: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous ſpirit can no more forbear mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then a ſtone can forbear falling to the Center.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Think on this alſo, that Gods end in bringing back the creature, is ſuch as cannot be accompliſhed without this mourning. For his end is the <hi>Exaltation of his Grace:</hi> Grace is no grace to an unbroken ſpirit; Sermons of mercy are but empty ſounds to a man that knows not what ſorrow is. God intends to make Chriſt precious; but what is a ſalve, a plaiſter, though the beſt in the world, to a man that is whole? Chriſt came indeed to ſave the miſerable; but that man that is not brought to ſee his miſery, and mourn over it, cares not for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Gods end is the <hi>engaging of the Creature to himſelf:</hi> but that man will never think himſelf beholding to God, that knows not what he hath done againſt God. But when he ſees what a wretch he hath been, and his heart is ſtricken within him, and he lies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169957:143"/> melting in ſorrow, and clothed with ſhame before God; now he thinks body and Soul too little for God; now if he had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lives, they ſhould all go for God; now he ſaith, <hi>What can I render to the Lord? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods end is to bring his people in ſo, <hi>that they may be faſt when they are in,</hi> that they may not go forth again. But he that thinks himſelf off from ſins that he never mourn'd for, and thinks he hath eſcaped evil courſes that he hath not been broken for, will return again. A mourning ſpirit makes a Chriſtian ſtedfaſt in his courſe, and this will be a bar between him and his luſt; He that knows not to mourn, knows nor to ſtand faſt: Certainly where there is not a ſpirit of mourning, that man hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd himſelf to God to this day: For that which is the principle of ſuch ſelf-reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth by its vertue alſo work mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, abaſement, and brokenneſs of heart. If the ſight of God in all his goodneſs be that which moves and draws the Soul as with a cord unto God, that very goodneſs of God which is ſo apprehended will alſo break and melt the Soul. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. ſaith God, <hi>I harkened and heard, but they ſpake not aright; no man repented of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Every one turned to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel.</hi> This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169957:144"/> made many promiſes, that they would walk better with God; but being not touch'd with an effectual ſenſe of their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dealings with God, they repented not; Therefore they returned every man to his own ways, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If any one now ſhould ſay, I have little of this ſorrow, and therefore do ſuſpect my ſelf;</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. There is a <hi>paſsionate</hi> mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which lies in weeping, crying and howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and this every one hath not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>a mental</hi> mourning, where a man ſees the things to be mourned for, and where he hath ſuch a ſpirit, that carries him againſt his way, and againſt himſelf, and is full of wiſhes; O that I had never been ſo againſt God, and O that I might never do ſo again; and makes the Soul walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; it cannot be proud now, nor lift up it ſelf, becauſe it remembers what it hath been and done againſt God. Canſt thou find theſe things in thy ſelf?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, There is a mourning of <hi>pure neceſsity;</hi> not <hi>willingly and contentfully,</hi> but ſo as a man cannot avoyd it: God preſents himſelf angry, and ſhews ſin in its colour, and then not an <hi>Ahab</hi> nor a <hi>Judas</hi> can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear mourning; but this mourning is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs: But true mourning is ſweet, ſweeter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169957:144"/> then all the comforts in the world: A right ſpirit puts the ſweetneſs of Heaven in mourning; God cannot pleaſe him better with any thing, then by touching his ſpirit, and laying it low before him. If then thine heart be touched of God, and thou love him, and feel ſome meltings, thou rejoyceſt, and purſt not off this ſorrow, but bids it welcome; and when God as a Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes thee, thou bleſſeſt him, and loveſt him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a mourning that is <hi>by fits,</hi> not <hi>habitual.</hi> The verieſt hypocrite in the world you may find ſometimes in his cloſet before God, and he will be weeping and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and taking on heavily by fits; but take him a while after, and he is like the dry ground after a Land flood, hard as a ſtone. True mourning is another frame of ſpirit, wherein the ſpirit in an uſual courſe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with abaſement, and a ſecret lamenting within; <hi>O wretch that I am! how have I lived? thus and thus have I done:</hi> He min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles the comforts of this world with theſe ſorrows, and will have place for this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of all things, and cannot but oftentimes have his eye upon himſelf, like <hi>Paul, I was a Perſecuter, and a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, There is a mourning that is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169957:145"/> 
                  <hi>afflicting,</hi> but not <hi>changing.</hi> Many trouble and vex themſelves upon the remembrance of their ways, a fire burns in their bowels that they cannot extinguiſh, but it doth not purge them from their droſs; their tears be ſalt and briniſh, but not healing; they hang down their heads, and walk ſadly, but carry the ſame ſpirit ſtill againſt God: ſo <hi>Ahab;</hi> ſo they in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6. Upon <hi>Samuels</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to them; <hi>they gathered together at Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured out before the Lord, and faſted, and ſaid, We have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord. [They drew water,]</hi> It's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that this drawing of water is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their mourning, and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mourning; <hi>and they faſted,</hi> which is an addition, and confeſſed, ſaying, We have ſinned againſt the Lord: But it came to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as you may ſee in the eighth Chapter. Thou mourneſt aright when thine heart is changed, and when thy mourning tends to the killing of thy ſin.</p>
               <p>A fourth thing concerning this Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, <hi>that it is but in part,</hi> and <hi>yet is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the whole.</hi> It is <hi>in part,</hi> for no man hath actually, perfectly given himſelf to God; in this very gift and holy act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation there is imperfection, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting, and much more in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this engagement all along: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169957:145"/> this Reſignation is <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>entire,</hi> partly in Gods <hi>acceptance;</hi> God is pleaſed to take it ſo, to take a part for the whole, as much as man can do, as if all were done. And it is whole and entire in mans <hi>intention and deſire:</hi> Though the deſire be not perfect, and the intent not perfect as to the degree, yet both reach to the extent of of that which God calls for: Leſs then this cannot be in a good man, and a man beloved of God; A man cannot ſay, <hi>I am thine,</hi> if he come not to this. For conſider, God treating with man about this work, when he comes to plead for a Reſignation, he treats not for part, but for all. Beſides, when man comes to plead with God, he pleads not for part, but for all; he would be ſaved, not in body alone, but in Soul too; he would be perfectly ſaved. And take this alſo, that God gives himſelf wholly unto man; if he did not give him his Wiſdom, and Power, and Love, man could not love him; for how could we love him, if his Wiſdom, Power, or any of his glorious Attributes, were againſt us? God gives himſelf to man wholly.</p>
               <p>Again, God <hi>cannot take leſs then all:</hi> for to accept of a partial reſignment, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a man a right and power over himſelf to live according to his own will, is to act
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169957:146"/> againſt thoſe very Laws of his, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot diſpenſe with: As to take that which is the firſt and fundamental Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any now upon the apprehenſion of the truth of this ſhould ſay, This makes me fear and ſuſpect my ſelf, becauſe I do not find that this giving up of my ſelf is ſo entire and compleat;</p>
               <p>I would have ſuch conſider, that Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation lies not ſo much in <hi>doing and being</hi> all that God requires, as in <hi>willingneſs</hi> to be and to do all. It is neceſſary to be and to do all that God requires, and we are obliged to this; but this Reſignation lies chiefly in this, in being willing to be and to do ſo: that is a ſpeech methinks that falls pat with the condition of the people of God, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.11. <hi>O Lord, let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy ſervants, who deſire to fear thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let there be no miſtake; for when I ſay, Reſignation lies chiefly in a willingneſs to be and to do all that God requires, mark what <hi>kind of willingneſs</hi> it is, it muſt be <hi>ſuch as is vigorous,</hi> as puts on to endevors, ſo that it ſets the Soul down mourning when it finds ſhortneſs of power. I add this, leſt any (as the world oftentimes doth) ſhould hurt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169957:146"/> himſelf by ſuch an excuſe as this, <hi>I confeſs I do not, but I would do well; my ways are not good, but I like them not; my heart is better:</hi> The world will one day ſee how deſtructive and fallacious theſe pleas are.</p>
               <p>Again, There is a great difference between ſin <hi>dwelling</hi> in us, and ſin <hi>entertained</hi> by us; between ſin <hi>remaining,</hi> and ſin <hi>reſerved:</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſin is againſt the nature of this abſolute Reſignation; but a man that truly reſigns himſelf, may and doth want power to caſt forth of doors every ſin, and every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it: No man that hath reſigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, doth entertain it; he doth not like it, nor comply with it; he doth not plot, conſpire, or deviſe how he may ſave and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his ſin; he lives not in the purpoſes of it; this is againſt the nature of reſigning our ſelves to God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This work of Reſignation is <hi>a work once done, and yet always doing.</hi> When God hath ſo wrought upon the heart by effectual perſwaſions, and his mighty power, God ſaith, <hi>I am thy God,</hi> and the Soul anſwers in truth, <hi>And I am thine:</hi> Now is the Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion actually made. But though this be done, yet it is ſtill always doing while we are in this world; nay to Eternity: for it's a thing that conſiſts of an iteration of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied acts. As Wedlock is not one ſingle act
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169957:147"/> of giving of perſons each to other; but if they live like married perſons as they ſhould, there is a dayly giving of themſelves each to other; their hearts go out every day with complaceney and delight, rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in renewing the bond, and making the league yet firmer and firmer. It's ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This Reſignation is ſuch a thing, as <hi>when 'tis once done, is never undone.</hi> Herein this Contract of man with God differs from all others in the world, for all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts have a time to ceaſe: By Contract one becomes another mans ſervant for a time. The moſt durable Contract is that of Marriage; yet it admits of a double breach, by death or by divorce: But here neither of theſe take place; there's no divorce after marriage with God, and no death comes unto that Soul which becomes his: for theſe two things hold ſuch a man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>infinite goodneſs</hi> of God, with which the Soul is ſo ſatisfied and contented, that it cannot in any conſtant courſe and ſtay continue, and give up it ſelf to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing; no more then a man can be willing to leave the light of the Sun, to go to live where there is no light but of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; or to forſake Paradiſe if he were in it, to live in a Deſart.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:169957:147"/>
               <p>But beſides, There is not only <hi>infinite goodneſs</hi> as an <hi>attractive object</hi> to hold the Soul of man when once come to God, but the <hi>almighty Power</hi> of God that holds us to himſelf, and keeps in his way the ſpirits of ſuch as have reſigned themſelves unto him. If he that had a bird fly into his breſt at Sea would not kill it, becauſe it came thither for refuge; how much more will God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe who commit themſelves to him? <hi>You are kept,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>by the mighty power of God through faith unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any ſhould ſay here again, Is it ſo where there is a reſignation of the Soul to God? I fear I am miſtaken that break my Covenant dayly; I have ſaid I would be his, but have broken my word, in many things have walked after the counſel of my own heart:</p>
               <p>I anſwer; The Covenant between God and Man in Chriſt is not broken in <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions,</hi> but when <hi>violence</hi> is offered to the <hi>whole Law of this Contract.</hi> There is this difference between this Covenant and the firſt Covenant made with <hi>Adam;</hi> Man ſtood ſo engaged, that one breach, one fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undid him, and diſcharged God; but this Contract is of a more excellent nature, ſo that it is not this ſin and that, nor another
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169957:148"/> ſin that diſſolves the Covenant; though they be ſins againſt it, and injuries againſt God, yet God doth not hold himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to caſt off his people for them. As it is with a father and his child, and with the husband and the wife; every angry word or neglect of carriage in either, is a ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that relation, but not to occaſion one to caſt off the other: but when violence is offered to the whole Law of that relation, this makes a diſſolution.</p>
               <p>And then though all the People of God have cauſe to be humbled f r ſinning againſt a Covenant ſo firm, and againſt ſuch grace and mercy therein; yet let them know they have no reaſon to be diſcouraged: for though through ſin that dwells in them they may be over-ruled in this or that, yet that very ſin tends to the deſtruction of ſin, and God doth break ſin by ſin, as one wave breaks another, or as one heat deſtroys ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And as inward diſeaſes are cured by breaking out; and Rats and Mice, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their holes, being diſcovered, are deſtroyed; and as evil roots that are in the Earth, when they appear and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it tends to their eradication: ſo God out-reaches the Devil in his deſign, who thinks by ſin to deſtroy the Soul, and God by ſin deſtroys ſin.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:169957:148"/>
               <p>The Conſideration of the nature of that Engagement wherein the Souls of Saints have engaged themſelves to God, ſhould be ſuch, that ſin ſhould be more bitter to them, more dreadful then Hell it ſelf; and it is hardly poſſible that a man upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the excellency of that grace in this Covenant, ſhould embolden himſelf to ſin againſt God.</p>

               <p>NOw we come to conſider the End of this Reſignation of our ſelves to God, to what end or for what we do reſign our ſelves unto him. I ſhall expreſs it in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To be <hi>governed and ordered by God in all our motions, both inward and outward.</hi> When we come to God, we come in a ſtate of ſubordination, as inferiors; and the end of our coming to God is [that he might] reſtore us to our primitive ſtate, with ſome additional grace and favor; which ſtate was a ſtate of Communion with God, but yet in ſubjection to God. To be under the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169957:149"/> government of God, lies in theſe two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>To have the Will of God to be our Bounds.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>To have it to be our Pattern and Rule.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The Will of God is that which muſt ſo <hi>circumſcribe</hi> and <hi>confine</hi> us, as that we are not left at liberty to any action of our own, but we muſt do it by order. There is no creature which God hath made, but he hath ſet certain limits to it, which it ſhould not paſs; as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the Sea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.9. <hi>God hath ſet bounds to it, which it cannot paſs,</hi> which it cannot go beyond. So God, though he hath given unto man a larger compaſs in point of activity, yet he hath not left him without bounds; he hath bounded his time, and hath ſet bounds to his <hi>power;</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, Chap. 14.5. <hi>His days are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and the number of his months are with thee: Thou haſt appointed him bounds, which he cannot paſs.</hi> Laws are very often expreſſed by the name of Bounds; and in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.10. it's ſaid concerning the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>they were as thoſe that removed the bounds:</hi> That is, as fields are ſet out by Boundaries, and every man thereby knows his own, and is to keep within his compaſs; ſo God hath bounded theſe Princes and all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169957:149"/> the people by Laws and Conſtitutions which he had given them; but they offered violence to his Laws, and removed the Bounds, to enlarge themſelves unduly.</p>
               <p>To be bounded by God, is to do nothing but what God either doth <hi>command</hi> or <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi> In 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.8. it's ſaid to <hi>Jeroboam, God rent the Kingdom away from the houſe of David, and gave it to thee; and yet thou haſt not been as my ſervant David, who kept my Commandments, and followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;</hi> that is, it was his dayly diſpoſition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, intention, and endevor; not that he did ſo indeed; for God himſelf in the very next Chap. makes an exception, at ver. 5. he ſaith, that <hi>he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing he commanded him all the days of his life, ſave only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</hi> That is to be bounded, when a man doth nothing but what he is commanded or warranted.</p>
               <p>All things are not commanded that we may do, but Commands and Warrants are the utmoſt latitude of that freedom which is left to us; we have no further to go, indeed we need not; there is ſcope enough to keep within theſe limits. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.96. ſaith <hi>David, I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy Commandments are exceeding large:</hi> That is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169957:150"/> as if he ſhould ſay, I have walked over the fair fields of every creature, I have looked to the extent of all goodneſs in them, and I could ſee beyond it; but when I look upon the Commandments of God, the Word of God, as it is either mandatory or promiſory, it is of ſo vaſt dimenſions, ſo exceeding great, that it exceeds all things in this world; here is room enough for the ſpirit of a man that is in true ſubjection unto God.</p>
               <p>Nay, as we <hi>have no need to ſtep beyond this bound,</hi> ſo <hi>if we do,</hi> it is <hi>extravagancy</hi> and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and not freedom, but bondage; it is but as a man that ſteps out of his way, and falls into a pit; or as a man that ſteps from his habitation, and ſlips into a priſon; it is a dangerous thing for us to enlarge: <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.6. For this very thing God threatened them; he ſaith, <hi>Becauſe they had withdrawn from him, that he would feed them as a lamb in a large place: Iſrael ſlides back as a backſliding heifer; now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place. Like a lamb in a large place;</hi> What's that? Like a lamb not kept within her fold, and appointed paſtures, under the ſuper-viſion and care of a vigilant Paſtor and Shepherd, but left to ramble at its own will: Indeed God ſaith, Becauſe they would not be content to live within the bounds that he had ſet them, he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169957:150"/> them by captivity, they ſhould wander from Country to Country.</p>
               <p>And as to have the Mind of God our Bounds, <hi>is to do nothing but what is agreeable to his Will, ſo it is to do all that he requireth. This is that which the Lord thy God requireth of thee, to do all theſe things that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes.</hi> All muſt be done, both that wherein we are concerned in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> with all men, and that which we receive by <hi>particular charge</hi> from God. Every one of us, beſides the general bonds that lie upon us as men, hath ſomething that lies upon us in reſpect of our particular charge, place, relation, and condition. Look to your ſelves in this, that you find your ſelves bounded here by God, elſe you are at large, and free from righteouſneſs. You have many people that will in ſome meaſure keep pace with the Commandment in general things; the worſt of men will hear, and pray, &amp;c. but look to them in their places, and there you ſhall find them extreamly deficient, refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and exorbitant: So far indeed as a Command of God falls in with their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and advantage, they will own it; thus even the worſt of men are often diligent in their callings, becauſe they live by them: But look upon thoſe Commands that do moſt try them, wherein they have moſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169957:151"/> to diſcover what their ſpirit is, and there you ſhall find them like wilde Aſſes, untamed creatures, children of <hi>Belial,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yoke, living according to no Rule. Thoſe relations eſpecially which are in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, are ſo ill managed through a ſpirit of pride, that hates all ſuperintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and whatſoever is above it, that to this day they are the burden of the world. But whoſoever it is that doth not own God in all things, that man is not bounded by God, and ſo is his own man, he is left to the guidance of a miſerable and deſtructive creature.</p>
               <p>When we give our ſelves to God, to be commanded and governed by him, it is to a ſubjection that is abſolute, and not conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. When you take a ſervant, it may be he'l ſay to you when you bid him do this and that, It was none of my bargain, I am contented to be your Steward, but not to ſerve you in the Stable; I am contented thus far to ſerve you, but here is my bounds. But when we come to God there is no ſuch treaty; we come to ſerve God abſolutely, to be at his command abſolutely in every thing whatſoever: For the Law of God is indiviſible and indiſpenſible; if you cannot give your ſelves to the obedience of all, you have done nothing: <hi>He that offends in one, is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169957:151"/> a tranſgreſſor of the whole Law, Jam.</hi> 2.10. that is, he tranſgreſſeth the authority of the whole Law, and he tranſgreſſeth the ſence and meaning of the Law; which was, not that we ſhould hold our ſelves obliged in many things, and free in ſome other, but that we ſhould ſubject and ſubmit our ſelves to God in every thing; you do nothing, if not all things. As in a journey of a hundred miles, if you be content to go ninety nine and no more, you loſe the end if you ſtop there. If God tell you, Theſe are my words, and I'le have them all looked to; and you look to many, but not to all; at that one gap you enter into death, and by that one thing neglected you ſhut your ſelves out of eternal life: If there be any one way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you do not ſubmit unto God, in that you are loſt. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. it's ſaid of <hi>Caleb</hi> (in compariſon of the reſt of the people) <hi>But my ſervant Caleb, becauſe he had another ſpirit, and followed me fully.</hi> The people did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yea many things that God required of them, but at ſome they ſtuck, and came not off with ſubjection; But ſaith God, <hi>My ſervant Caleb had another ſpirit, and he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me fully,</hi> or <hi>wholly;</hi> he did whatſoever I commanded: and that muſt be the compaſs of our obedience. The Will of God muſt be our bounds, which we muſt not paſs;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169957:152"/> and to the utmoſt compaſs thereof we muſt endeavor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be under the Command and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, is <hi>when the Will of God is our Rule and Pattern;</hi> ſo that we act not the things only that are enjoyned, but as they are enjoyned and commanded. You have an example of this in that holy man, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3. When as <hi>Ezra,</hi> and others of the Rulers with him, had declared themſelves againſt the ſin of the Congregation in min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling themſelves in marriage with ſtrangers, and had humbled themſelves before God with the people; <hi>Shechaniah</hi> ſtood up, as in verſ. 2. and ſaith thus, <hi>Now therefore let us make a Covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and ſuch as are born of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Counſel of the Lord, and let it be done according to the Law.</hi> The Law in caſe of tranſgreſſion, what doth it require? That we return from our obliquities and wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with mourning and with abaſement; that we reform ſpeedily and vigorouſly, with a deep ſenſe of our going from God: So would he have their ſtrange wives and children to be put out from among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God without delay, and with a deep ſenſe of that tranſgreſſion by which they had offended God.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice to have ſpoken of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169957:152"/> firſt Branch of the end of our Reſignation, that is to be commanded by God, and to be under his Government.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>That we be diſpoſed by him according to his Will:</hi> Now that lies in theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In a contentation of mind in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein God ſets us;</hi> to be at peace and ſilent in our ſpirits towards God, to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in our hearts, what ever condition God in his wiſdom ſees good to put us into. This is a bleſſed Leſſon to them that have learned it: <hi>Paul</hi> had, and every good man hath in his meaſure; <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. <hi>I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi> The Greek word for <hi>contentment</hi> imports <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency:</hi> That man is well that doth thus; he is as if he had all, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all things, and yet wanting all things. Our Engliſh word and the Latin imports a ſpirit bounded, the ſpirit of a man contained and kept within his compaſs, and not like water let out of a veſſel, that runs hither and thither, and is loſt, but kept within its bounds.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>contentment from the object,</hi> the thing we enjoy, as when that doth fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer our expectation: but that is not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; when a man hath what his heart deſires, when nothing is wanting, there not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169957:153"/> to quarrel is no great vertue. But it's a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment that ariſeth from <hi>Reaſon and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when though a mans condition be not ſo pleaſing, yet in reſpect of him by whom he is diſpoſed, and in reſpect of the end of it, and in reſpect of the ingredients wherewith God mingles his ſtate, he is at reſt. Not that this requires an excluding of all <hi>deſire</hi> to have his ſtate otherwiſe, or an excluding of all <hi>grief</hi> under the ſenſe of any evil of a mans condition; but that the heart run not <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately</hi> and <hi>impetuouſly</hi> with deſires after change, when it is not well with us; nor are we <hi>dejected</hi> and <hi>ſowred</hi> in our ſpirits, becauſe it is ill with us. When Chriſt was near unto death, and that Cup ready to be reached in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand, he had a deſire to eſcape it, and vented his deſire in prayer; <hi>If it be poſsible let this Cup paſs from me.</hi> But as it was the glory of Jeſus Chriſt to ſubmit to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will, ſo here is the excellency of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in a Chriſtian, when though he can truly ſay, and may ſay, My caſe is hard, and there is much in it to afflict nature; yet I will lay my hand upon my mouth, that I offend not with my tongue; I will lie quietly under the Hand and Will of God.</p>
               <p>That's one Branch of our Willingneſs to be diſpoſed by God, to be contented in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169957:153"/> ſtate wherein God ſets us; and he that underſtands not this, hath not yet known God, nor ſeen him; I mean, he that doth not this, nor can do it, is a ſtranger to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Branch of being willing to be at Gods diſpoſing, is <hi>an indifferency of mind in reſpect of any poſsible change where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are called according to the Wiſdom and Will of God;</hi> to be willing to be changed, and poured as water from veſſel to veſſel according to the Will of God. You ſhall find an eminent example of this in <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25. When <hi>Zadock</hi> was by the Ark, the King ſaid to him, <hi>Carry back the Ark of God into the City; if I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me hither again, and ſhew me both it and his habitation; but if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, here I am, let him do with me as ſeemeth him good.</hi> This muſt be the language of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirit that doth own God as his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, to whom he hath ſubjected himſelf: What are thoſe that are the people of God, but as ſheep before the Shepherd, that muſt change their paſture at their Shepherds will and wiſdom? What are they but as Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that muſt march hither and thither as they are cammanded? or as veſſels in the houſe, that ſtand to be filled or emptied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169957:154"/> to pleaſure? or as ſervants that muſt go and come as they are bid, and not to ſtay in any place at their wills? There are two things contrary to this frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which muſt be looked to, and taken heed of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, <hi>An eager and over-vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proſecution after any good that we want, any thing that we would have, or be in this world;</hi> as it was with <hi>Rachel, Give me chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or elſe I dye.</hi> The Soul that runs out thus after any thing in this preſent world, is a Soul without bounds, hath caſt off God, denyed his Soveraignty, Authority and Command over him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing that is contrary to this, is <hi>an obſtinate cleaving or holding to any ſtate or condition in the world, be it never ſo amiable, ſweet or ſuitable to our deſires:</hi> To hold this faſt, and not to be willing to go out of it when God bids us, is to deny God; it is not to own God in his power of diſpoſing us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will. We muſt endeavor, and it muſt be in our meaſure with us as it was with <hi>Abraham; Abraham</hi> was at eaſe; Well, ſaith God, <hi>Get thee out from thy fathers houſe, and from thy Country; do as I bid thee, leave all, and go to a Land which thou haſt not ſeen or known: and Abraham went.</hi> There are ſome that in the midſt of their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169957:154"/> are as men in chains, they are marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cannot endure to think of a divorce from that ſtate; it's death to them to think of a change. To be brought into diſgrace after honor, and after the ſweetneſs of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be brought into bondage, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brook it. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in Chap. 2.6. ſpeaks of ſome, that <hi>lade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with thick clay.</hi> What's the reaſon that the treaſures of this world are compared to thick clay? Becauſe when men get into the poſſeſſion of them, they commonly ſtick faſt, as men in the mire. But if thou ſtick faſt in the Creature, thou art ſeparated from the Creator; if thine heart be in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſtate of confederacy and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with any things in this world, thou art at odds with God, and haſt ſhaken hands with him. This is the firſt thing which was propounded to be ſpoken of, What Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our ſelves to God is.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Reſignation neceſſary in Prayer. Prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it hath no truth in it, is non-ſence, and impoſeth upon God abſurdly. The true Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a ſpirit of Reſignation as to Prayer.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="2">2. THe ſecond thing is, Why we muſt do this when we come to pray?</p>
               <p>Conſider, If you come to God to ask any thing at his hands, which you would enjoy, and of which you have great neceſſity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a diſpoſition and frame of ſpirit, as you have heard, <hi>you pray, but not in truth:</hi> there is no truth in your recourſe to God; thine action is falſe, treacherous and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, there is no truth in it. For conſider, when you come to God, you come with a profeſſed ſenſe of your indigence, and your dependance upon God; if you did not want, you would not ask; you come with a profeſſed ſenſe of the all-ſufficiency of God and his dominion over you, and you come and ſay, <hi>Lord, and great God, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the World, &amp;c.</hi> Now what falſe deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this with God, to call him Lord, and not yield obedience to him? What abſurd dealing is this with the holy One, the true
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169957:155"/> God, the only wiſe God, to come in this faſhion to him? It is true, he is near to thoſe that call upon him, but it is to <hi>thoſe that call upon him in truth, Pſal.</hi> 145.18. You have an example of ſuch falſe dealing with God in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36. <hi>And they remembered God their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they flattered him with their mouths, and lyed to him with their tongues; for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> It was an uſual thing with this people to come in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diſtreſſes, and ſay, <hi>Ariſe, O Lord, and ſave us, and we will walk with thee;</hi> but they did lye with their lips, and flatter God with their falſe and diſſembling words, and minded not what they ſpake, but were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</p>
               <p>Further, When a man comes to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion, as a Suiter, not giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, <hi>he ſpeaks no ſence at all;</hi> his prayer is a piece of non-ſence, there is no judgment nor reaſon in it, but a heap of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions and folly. If any ſhould come to God perſiſting in the evil of his ways, not having his heart ſet toward God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubject to him in all things, he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf praying againſt evil, and yet loves evil: We pray againſt a particular evil, and we love the greateſt evil; that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169957:156"/> which is all evil, and the cauſe of all evil. What contradiction is here? We pray for mercy, O that God would ſhew me mercy in this thing! and yet we ſhew no mercy to our ſelves; but do that by which we weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, poyſon and deſtroy our ſelves, and with contentment; and yet we come to God, and ſay, Lord have mercy on us: This is folly, extremity of folly.</p>
               <p>When you come to God, you come for this or that good; <hi>Lord, give me health,</hi> or <hi>give me enlargement,</hi> or <hi>ſupply me in my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities; deliver me from this danger, &amp;c.</hi> Men come for ſome particular good, and they hate that which is all good, the chief and univerſal good. Thou wouldſt have life and health in this world, but not Jeſus Chriſt; thou careſt not for eternal life. What contradiction and folly is this, while you cry for good, and hate good? You walk in ways of contradiction againſt God, and hate him in your hearts: You ſay, <hi>Lord ſave me;</hi> when, it may be, you have ſome ſenſe upon your ſpirits of the ſad condition of men gone out of the world, and of your own preſent ſtate to be like theirs. Thou wouldſt have God ſave thee, and yet thou deſtroyeſt thy ſelf: What ſayſt thou, O man? wilt thou depart from the evil of thy ways? O no, ſaith the Soul. Will any man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169957:156"/> hold forth his hand to a Chyrurgeon, and pray him to cure him, and at the ſame time gaſh and wound himſelf? Would any man pray to the Judg, <hi>O Sir, pray ſave my life,</hi> and at the ſame time drink down poyſon? And yet this is the dayly dealing of men with God; they pray to him, but they are fools; they offer up moſt intolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Except a man come to God with an heart ſubmitting to him, he <hi>impoſeth moſt ſtrange and horrid things upon God:</hi> For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſaith in his heart, that God knows not what his intentions are (he never means nor hath an heart to forſake this or that ſin) which is to make him no God; or elſe, if he thinks that God knows his heart, and yet he will take the boldneſs to come to God, and cry for mercy, and to be helped and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: Mark what he impoſeth upon God hereby, he would have God act ſtrangely againſt his own Wiſdom; the language of that mans prayer is, Do but ſave my life at this time, and I will ſin more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; Do but let me enjoy mine eſtate, and it ſhall be the fomentor of my luſts, and the weapons of mine unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt thee; do but take off my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will be like an untamed Aſs in the deſart. God hath <hi>declared and revealed his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169957:157"/> wrath from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men that hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> men that know what they ſhould do, and do it not; yet they are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to God, and to themſelves, that they will not ſuffer this truth to work upon their ſpirits: theſe men call to God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when as God hath declared that <hi>he will ſhew no mercy to men that walk thus in the ſtubbornneſs of their hearts;</hi> but that his wrath ſhall burn againſt them, that he will be their Enemy, and oppoſe himſelf to all their wickedneſs. When thou knoweſt thy heart is ſtark naught, and art privy to thy ſecret miſchievous intentions unto God and to his Truth, thou comeſt to beg of God to ſhew thee mercy, which ſo much goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will; ſee what thou impoſeſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nature of God, who is moſt good and holy; thou in the baſeneſs and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy heart, which holdeſt a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with ſin, comeſt to God in this infinite contradiction wherein thou ſtandeſt to him, and beggeſt of him that he will take thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſom, and be kind unto thee. Was there ever ſuch a requeſt made to a man, that he would take this Serpent and that Toad into his boſom? I know God doth ſo in effect, but then they ceaſe to be ſuch: Never doth a man put up a prayer to God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169957:157"/> with a purpoſe of continuing in his ſin, but he impoſeth a ſtrange thing on the Will of God. <hi>Micah</hi> 3.11. It is ſaid, <hi>They build Zion with blood, and yet will they loan upon the Lord.</hi> And you have a pregnant example, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Wilt thou turn when we cry to thee, my Father? will he reſerve his anger for ever?</hi> Here is a great ſenſe of evil; but ſaith he, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken and done evil things;</hi> and at that very time was the hearts of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſet againſt God, when they came beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying and crying that God would help them and ſhew them mercy. That ſhall ſuffice for the ſecond thing; Why, when we come to God, we muſt come with reſigning of our ſelves, with a hearty giving up of our ſelves to his Commands, and in all things to be diſpoſed of by him.</p>
               <p>A third thing propounded was, What Argument this is, or wherein the force of it lies, that we ſhould plead this with God, <hi>[Save me, for I am thine?]</hi> There is a three-fold ſtrength in this Argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which obligeth a father to be good to his child, the husband to his wife, &amp;c. And God hath ſubjected himſelf more unto the Law of Nature, he lies more under it, then any of theſe; and doth more perfectly, fully and gloriouſly fulfil this Law of Nature, then any; ther
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169957:158"/> is no father like him, no friend, no husband like him. <hi>Can a mother forget her child? can ſhe? Yet I will not forget thee, Iſai.</hi> 49.4. A mother can hardly do it; Nature teacheth her to have bowels, and a merciful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance toward her child; much more will I, ſaith God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we can ſay to God, I am thine, we <hi>plead the Covenant that God hath made with us, wherein he is become our Father and Friend:</hi> And this is that which was pleaded in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſs, or ſurely thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknowledg us not,</hi> (becauſe they are gone, and ſo have no cogniſance of us now;) <hi>yet Thou, O Lord, art our Father and our Redeemer; thy Name is upon us.</hi> See what a concluſion here is made; Doubtleſs thou art our Father, and therefore we call to thee for help.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is this encouragement and ſtrength that the ſpirit of a man receives in thus arguing with God, <hi>that if he can ſay in truth, I am thine, God much more will ſay to the creature, I am thine.</hi> If we have ſo much love to offer our ſelves to God, to become his; much more will the love of God make him to become ours: for God loves firſt, and moſt, and ſureſt. If mine heart riſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, much more is the heart of God
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169957:158"/> toward me; becauſe there Love is in the Fountain.</p>

                  </label> If there muſt be ſuch a Reſigning of our ſelves to God, when we come to him, then truly you need never fear the prayers of the men of this world; aſſure your ſelves they wiſh you as much evil as it is poſſible, and their hearts cannot love you, they envy all your welfare, and the conſtant vote of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is, that your day were turned into night, and that in ſtead of light darkneſs ſhould be round about you; but it matters not; though they put up ſuch prayers to God, they are but <hi>bruta fulmina.</hi> The reaſon of it is, becauſe they come to God without that which is the nerves and ſinews of prayer: If they come to God, and bow the knee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that God would bleſs them, and proſper them; poor Creatures! they ſpeak
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169957:159"/> to no purpoſe, becauſe they deal hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with God; for they bow the knee, and call him Lord, as if he were their Lord; but they do what they liſt, and are their own Lords, Rulers and Commanders. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. God ſaith the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> dealt ſo with him, <hi>They did not cry to me with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds, and aſſembled themſelves for corn and for wine, and rebelled againſt me.</hi> They pray that God would do ſo ſuch a good turn for them, but they ſhut their hearts againſt God, and had a rebellious ſpirit at the ſame time: <hi>Though I have ſtrengthened their arm, yet they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned miſchief againſt me;</hi> They are no friends of my Cauſe and Kingdom in this world, but wiſh their overthrow, though I have ſhewed them mercy. In <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.7, 8. it's ſaid, <hi>They have ſet their hearts on iniquity, and it ſhall be like people, like Prieſts; and I'le puniſh them for their ways, and reward them for their doings;</hi> or as the word is, <hi>I will cauſe their doings to be turned upon them.</hi> Men may think when they come to God, that the ſins of ſo many years paſt are forgotten, that God will not reckon with them for ſins ſo long paſt; and ſo they come to God in their filth, and with their hearts unwaſhen: But ſaith God, They are deceived, I will turn their ways upon them; and though they be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169957:159"/> ſins of ſo long time backward, yet I'le re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them. In <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Iſrael cryed to me, My God, we know thee:</hi> What ſaith God? <hi>Iſrael hath caſt off the thing that is good, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſhall purſue him; They have ſet up Kings, but not by me, &amp;c.</hi> They ſay, My God, we know thee; No, ſaith God, I'le not know you, thou haſt caſt off the thing that is good. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2, 3. You have God expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this purpoſe, <hi>If you will not hear, and lay to heart, to give glory to my Name:</hi> A man diſhonors God, and puts the greateſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and affront upon God that can be, when he refuſeth to hear and obey; <hi>Then I'le curſe your bleſsings, and caſt even the dung of your ſolemn Feaſts on your faces, &amp;c.</hi> That's a ſtrange thing, but it was ſo; their ſolemn Feaſts were as dung to God, and God ſaith he will caſt them as dung in their faces; and they ſhall be a dunghill which my Soul abhors. You need not fear the prayers of ſuch men as are without yoke, and fear not God; but the prayers of Saints are to be dreaded, becauſe they have power with God; if they come to God and ſay, <hi>Save me, I am thine,</hi> God will anſwer, <hi>I am thine, I will ſave thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If when we come to God, we muſt make a reſignment of our ſelves to God, and acknowledg we are not our own, but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169957:160"/> his; Then we learn ſecondly, that the ſins of a praying people are the greateſt ſins; there be no ſins that are ſo out of meaſure ſinful, as the ſins of thoſe that pray, and pray moſt. Hath God made thee as a Prince with himſelf? hath God ſet open a door that thou mayſt have acceſs to him? hath he given thee leave in the day of thy ſtraits to pour out thy Soul? haſt thou in the midſt of thoſe mercies, in the ſenſe of the ſweetneſs of thoſe viſions, ſaid to God, that thou art his? and haſt thou departed from him? haſt thou given to him a withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhoulder? (as it's ſaid of them:) This ſin is of the higheſt nature, for it is a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Apoſtacy. Thoſe that are without God and Chriſt in the world are Apoſtates, but it is by one Apoſtacy, it is a continued act wherein they are held; but now thou art gone out from God, after thou hadſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him; thou haſt gone from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable refreſhings of the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and haſt offered violence to the many engagements which thou haſt layd, yea which they have layd upon thy Soul; thou haſt broken the bonds of them all. Sins after Reſignation, and after the matter of difference is taken up between God and the Creature, are not to be eaſily paſſed over; they are the worſt ſins. Remember your
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169957:160"/> ſelves, as many as have known Jeſus Chriſt; when you ſaid to God, that you would walk with him, did you mean it? And haſt thou fallen from the truth into a lye? The world many times come to God, and ſay many good words, that they will be his; but, as it's ſaid of them in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36. <hi>They flattered with their lips, and lyed with their tongues; their hearts were not ſtedfaſt in the Covenant with their God.</hi> They minded no ſuch thing, but thou didſt; and therefore boundſt thy ſelf more, thou didſt intend to be bound: When thou engagedſt thy ſelf to God, thou didſt it upon the greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, through the enforcement of the higheſt Arguments: thou feltſt the power of God conquering and ſubduing thee, and thou yieldedſt thy ſelf to be his for ever: And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how often thou haſt ſaid this to God. Is not the voyce of thy Soul ſtill in his ears? Doth not he remember the language thou haſt uttered? And after thou haſt ſaid it again and again, that thou wouldſt do no more ſo; after thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Thou art and ſhalt be my God;</hi> for thee to draw back, and ſtart aſide, it's a ſin that wants a name, it's ſo haynous in its kind, ſo horrid in its nature. What high injuſtice is this in thee, to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a liberty to thy ſelf, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly parted with it into his hands whoſe it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169957:161"/> was? Nay was it not after thou hadſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of walking in thine own ways? Didſt thou not know what ſin meant? It's an argument the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>[Wherein you ſometimes walked.]</hi> You know what it is to be in your ſins. Did you not in the day of your ſorrow ſay in your heart, <hi>I will go to God again? Oh! how happy was it when I was with him? How ſweet were thoſe days wherein I walked under the Government of Jeſus Chriſt? and was bleſſed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant communication of the counſel of the Spirit of life and peace?</hi> Was not that thy ſpeech which was the Churches? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I'le go and return to my firſt husband, for then it was better with me then now.</hi> Now after all this to ſin againſt God, to indulge your ſelves to take a liberty and freedom to tranſgreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, to whom you have ſo engaged your ſelves; what a breaking of heart, what ſhame of face ſhould this be? When now thou haſt put weakneſs upon the ſtrongeſt bonds, what haſt thou ſaid? <hi>Chriſt is nothing, of no account; there is more in my ſins then in Chriſt; there is more in the ſatisfaction of my own deſires, then in the enjoyment of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> for thou haſt left one for the other. Thou didſt think it was beſt, when thou didſt give thy ſelf to him; and what injury haſt thou done to the great and holy one?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169957:161"/> Thou haſt ſet light by him, to whom to be given thou thoughtſt it thy happineſs; thou thoughtſt it wonderful mercy that he would enter into a new Contract with thee; thou thoughtſt that ſhould be an everlaſting bond of Love upon thy Soul, that God ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain take thee a Run-away, that he ſhould again admit thee a Rebel and a Traytor; and haſt thou forgotten all this? Is God after all this to be ſet by? that thou canſt walk ſo, and do as thou liſt? Therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Conſiderations, the ſins of thoſe that are much with God, are greateſt; becauſe upon their converſings, parlies and treaties that they hold with God, ſtill they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg themſelves not to be their own, but his; ſuch therefore ſhew not the candor and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of a right ſpirit. It's a ſad demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a heart not under the power of divine Love, and very much alienated from God, that upon ſight of ſuch miſcarriages is not broken and melted. I do as much wonder at the ſpirit and doctrine of ſome men, as at any thing in the world; that are lifting the heads of Chriſtians above all ſorrow, that would abſent them from all mourning, that would have them to be all joy. Poor men, their language is unnatural: They muſt mourn, and cannot but mourn, if their hearts be right; He that knows and loves God,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169957:162"/> cannot but feel the pain and burden of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences againſt him. It's as impoſſible that Nature ſhould ceaſe to feel the ſmart of ſtripes and wounds, as that a ſpirit filled with or acted by divine Love, ſhould not feel the wounds and wrongs that it offers to his Maker. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhewed indeed his frailty, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.26. <hi>But [notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] Hezekiah humbled himſelf for the pride of his heart:</hi> That <hi>[notwithſtanding]</hi> is a word to be obſerved: When a mans heart wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth proud before God, and he can lift up himſelf and tranſgreſs with an high hand; when the heart glories in any thing, and by the brightneſs of other things, a darkneſs is caſt upon the ſpirit towards God; when this man comes to be humbled, it's a great thing: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was in ſuch a caſe as this, <hi>yet [notwithſtanding] Hezekiah humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label> We may further improve this Truth by way of Exhortation, <hi>partly</hi> to thoſe that yet have not given themſelves up to God, that have not ſaid in truth, <hi>I am thine;</hi> and <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to thoſe that have done it. There is a generation of men that are under no bonds to God, they acknowledg him not, that <hi>are free from righteouſneſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20. They have not ſo much many of them as felt the breakings of God, and thoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169957:162"/> contentions whereby he ſtrives with their unkindneſs and frowardneſs; they never ſo much as came to debate the matter; or treat with God about this great buſineſs, whether they ſhould be his or no; but live at peradventures, and are at their own ſwinge, walking after the <hi>will of the mind and of the fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort that have felt many tuggings of God upon them; God hath been hammering the matter upon them, but they have ſtood it out; ſometimes he hath brought them upon their knees, and to tears; nay to ſelf-judging, to condemn themſelves in his preſence, ſometimes they have cryed and roared in the preſence of God: ſuch wretches there are in the world, which have out-lived the workings of the power of God upon their ſpirits; as thoſe of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall no longer ſtrive with man.</hi> God ſpoke of that evil and wretched world, that though he had ſtriven, not only by the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of the Ark (which was a very loud Sermon,) but alſo with his Spirit; for there is no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men that are ever free from thoſe conteſts of God, but the light that is in them hath pleaded Gods cauſe againſt their wickedneſs and luſts: Well, ſaith God, now I ſee they have ſtood out all this while, <hi>my
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169957:163"/> Spirit ſhall no longer ſtrive with man; Let them alone,</hi> as he ſaid concerning <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 13. The Apoſtles language, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. (beſides many other Scriptures) ſuppoſeth that there is often a fight in our Souls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; <hi>Bringing every thought of the heart into obedience.</hi> That word, <hi>bringing into obedience,</hi> ſignifies a taking of the ſpirit of man as with a ſword or ſpear; God comes and arms himſelf againſt men; and when he comes thus in power, they yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, and they are bleſſed. But there are ſuch that always ſtand out, that <hi>reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> as thoſe ſtiff-necked Jews in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. Or if they yield, yet not in ſincerity, not in truth; but as it's ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Yet for all this her treacherous Siſter did not turn to me with the whole heart, but feignedly,</hi> or <hi>in falſhood.</hi> Now concerning theſe perſons I ſhall ſay but very few words. Canſt thou come to God with ſuch a ſpirit as this? What ſtate art thou in, O man? Thou muſt not, thou canſt not forbear praying: At one time or other the worſt in the world lift up their eyes and hearts to their Maker: The very Heathens do not, cannot withhold from this. If not the light that is in men, yet their ſtraits and afflictions will cauſe them to come as Petitioners to God: and wilt thou come to God with a petition in one hand,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169957:163"/> and with weapons of defiance in the other hand? Wilt thou come to God with the face of a Petitioner, and with the ſpirit of a Rebel? What infinite boldneſs is this with God? I have before ſhewed you the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridneſs of this kind of prayer, and the horrid things that ſuch prayers impoſe upon God. But conſider further, whileſt thou retaineſt a reſolution and bent of heart ſet towards thy ſin; and yet wilt pray; thou art in a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſinning, do thou what thou canſt: If thou doſt not pray, thou ſinneſt, by breaking of a Law of Nature, which enjoyns the creature to acknowledg his dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Maker, by prayer and ſupplication: If in the day of thy diſtreſs thou comeſt to ask mercy, thou ſinneſt more. So that thou art as a Ship between two Rocks, that muſt needs periſh upon one, there is no eſcaping: ſo is thy Soul in the midſt of ſin; and to be in the midſt of ſin, is to be in the midſt of death. And thou every day makeſt thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more unhappy; that wherein thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, and rejoyceſt, thy prayers are ſo far from being any reaſonable relief unto thee, that they are matter of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and aſtoniſhment to a man that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtands. What have I done? [may ſuch a man ſay:] I have been with God, and mock'd him to his face; I have called
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169957:164"/> him Lord, but I am not his ſervant; but ſerve my ſelf and divers luſts: I called my ſelf his Subject, but I am a Rebel. Nay this is a blaſpheming of God: Men commonly are afraid of blaſphemy; but thou that comeſt to God praying, but ſinning, (that is, having thy heart upon thy evil ways,) thou that comeſt praying, but not yielding; thou blaſphemeſt God to his face, thus; to make thy ſelf equal with God is blaſphemy; it was ſo judg'd in the heart of that people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. but they miſtook in the Caſe: But when thou makeſt thy ſelf the chiefeſt of thine own affections, thou makeſt thy ſelf equal with God, whoſe priviledg and ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy it is to be chiefeſt in the affections of his Creature, and to have the higheſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency over the ſpirits of his people, to command them. Nay thou makeſt thy ſelf greater then God, becauſe thou thinkeſt it nothing to tranſgreſs, to offend, and offer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to his Commands; but thou takeſt all pleaſure and contentment in gratifying thine own wicked ſpirit. Thou makeſt that greateſt to which thou moſt yieldeſt; when thou then yieldeſt unto ſin, and leaveſt God, haſt not thou made thy ſelf greater then God? Very high diſhonors are offered to God in ſuch a courſe, paſt expreſſion. Mark that in <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>If you will not hear and lay to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169957:164"/> heart, to give glory to my Name, I will even ſend a curſe upon you. If you will not hear and yield your ſelves to my Commands, to give me glory:</hi> [As if he had ſaid,] If you will not acknowledg me to be what I am, but deny me; if you will not ſubmit to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Wiſdom of my Commands, I'le ſend a Curſe upon you. And by this means thou doſt as thou canſt deſtroy that which doth only difference thee from Devils; for the Devils are caſt into that condemnation which ſhall come upon the world, but Man hath a poſſibility to eſcape: Now thou doſt what thou canſt to make thy Salvation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and to faſten and tye up thy Soul to the condemnation of thoſe apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; whileſt thou refuſeſt to turn unto God, from whom thou haſt departed; and doſt not acknowledg the grace and mercy of that open door for poor creatures to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the God of mercy.</p>
               <p>And be ſure of this, If you be not the Lords, the Lord will not be yours: You have ſuch a paſſage, <hi>They are not mine, break down their bulwarks;</hi> I'le take no knowledg of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe ſhe takes no knowledg of me. What a thing is this, that God ſtands with both hands to give out mercy to the Creature, (as it is ſaid of Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Length of days is in her right hand, and in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169957:165"/> her left hand riches and honour,</hi>) and that the Creature ſhall bend both his hands againſt God? Such a paſſage you have in <hi>Micah</hi> 7.3. <hi>Men do evil with both hands earneſtly.</hi> Now then conſider how much it concerns every one of you that have not yet given your ſelves to God to do it now. What an unhappy creature art thou if God ſhall ſhut out thy prayers, when ſtraits, fears and death come? Thy prayers are no more then the howling of Dogs and Wolves, becauſe thou prayeſt to God, and thy ſpirit is not given up in obedience to him.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now turn to thoſe who have given up their ſpirits to God; You muſt do it ſtill when you come to God. Faith and Love, which are two fundamental graces, of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal influence to all the reſt, are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually uſed and acted: Others are to be acted upon occaſion, but theſe have their conſtant work, every day theſe muſt be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When I ſay, that upon our coming to God, there muſt be a giving up of our ſelves to God; I mean theſe three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there muſt be <hi>a willing and hearty acknowledgment, that we are Gods, and not our own:</hi> We muſt ſee the bonds of God upon upon us, and like it, and own it; we muſt hate all other freedom that is offered us, we muſt account it true bondage, and be glad
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169957:165"/> that ſuch a day is come, wherein God took us out of our own hands, and hath taken us into his. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>I have ſworn, and will perform;</hi> I confeſs, Lord, that is my hand and my bond; I will not for a thouſand worlds go back. Certainly, there ſhould be no other ſpirit in you, when you come to God, but to acknowledg your ſelves to be his, and under his Commands; a Chriſtian cannot but do it. Partly, <hi>becauſe he ſees his happineſs lies in this;</hi> he ſees in his coming again to be the Lords, there is a reſtitution of all that bleſſedneſs from which he fell by his Apoſtacy. By becoming Gods, he ſees that God alſo is become his. How may the Soul raiſe it ſelf in joy, when it can ſay this, God is my God, all he hath and is, is mine; he is mine to all Eternity. The acknowledging of this engagement wherein he ſtands to God, and of Gods engaging of himſelf to him, is all his happineſs, from whence ſprings all his power and confidence in prayer; I can go boldly, ſaith he, to Heaven, becauſe God is my God; I can go and ask all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is mine, and I am his. Partly alſo, <hi>becauſe he loves him with a love of complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> the Soul hath all contentment in him: Never did a ſpouſe ſpeak to her husband, whom her Soul loved to the higheſt, more willingly, and ſay, <hi>I am thine,</hi> then the ſpirit
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169957:166"/> of an upright man ſaith to God, <hi>Lord, I am thine.</hi> And he loves him with a <hi>love of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs:</hi> Haſt thou given thy ſelf to me, ſaith he, and ſhall I then withhold my ſelf from thee? Haſt thou, who art ſo great, done all this for me? and ſhall I ſtand out againſt thee? He will willingly acknowledg him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be his; the Saints often do this: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> above twenty times comes with this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16. <hi>I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant.</hi> To ſay it once was not enough; he ſaith it again, to ſhew the ſincerity of his ſpirit, and to witneſs that his heart was fully pleaſed with this, that he was not his own, but the Lords.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be <hi>a perfecting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of our Reſignment:</hi> All beginnings are but cold; yet there are ſome excellencies in our primitive and firſt reſigning of our ſelves to God, which without great warineſs are not preſerved till after times. In the day of love, when God firſt comes with terms of peace, O how freely doth the Soul go out! and how willingly doth it offer it ſelf to him? The flower and beauty of this firſt love, how hardly are they maintained? But what ever ſpirit there is in our firſt love, it is certain that it's imperfect, and we therefore live to make it compleat: Compleat <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:169957:166"/> as our ſpirits and minds come to be enlarged in the knowledg of the Will of God, as God makes himſelf more known; I, ſaith the Soul, I will do that, and that too. And ſo <hi>intenſively,</hi> the heart and Soul cleaves unto God in more height and vigor of affection; as it is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> who walked with God before and was the Lords; yet in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.6. <hi>Jehoſaphats heart was lifted up in the ways of God:</hi> His ſpirit was raiſed before towards God, but now raiſed to an higher pitch, and greater ſtrength; he did encourage and fortifie himſelf in the ways of God.</p>
               <p>A third thing that muſt be done, is this; <hi>After any unfaithfulneſs, treachery, or baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God, there muſt be a renovation of our Reſignation:</hi> We muſt again give our ſelves to him. Having offered this injury to God, to deny him his right, we cannot again come to him, but we muſt reſtore it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg our ſelves to be his. It was good counſel given <hi>Job,</hi> by that friend of his, <hi>Job</hi> 34.31. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more: that which I ſee not, teach thou me; and if I have done iniquity, I'le do no more.</hi> With ſuch a ſpirit you muſt come to God; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have offered violence to that right thou haſt in me, but I'le do ſo no more; and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169957:167"/> here I am a ſtraying ſheep, I have a fooliſh rebellious heart; I offer my ſelf again to thy Government, and to the Conduct and and Command of thy ſpirit. There muſt be in thoſe that have given themſelves to God, a reſigning and giving up of themſelves in prayer. Conſider it, in vain elſe do we pray: God hath given us leave to come to him, and hath engaged himſelf to hear us; but upon condition; there muſt be a hearing on both ſides: He hath ſaid, that if any man come to him in the ſtoutneſs of his ſpirit, he will not regard him; he hath abundantly in the Scripture diſliked ſuch, and their prayers he hates. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.13, 14. you have a full expreſſion of this. Concerning this reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves to God, it cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with; God hath ſworn this ſhall be done: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, Every knee ſhall bow before me.</hi> God will have it done: He hath put conditions upon prayer; partly, <hi>becauſe he loves his people;</hi> he knows there is no greater happineſs to them, then to ceaſe to be their own, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his. As a father pities his child that wanders abroad in the deſart, and tells him, Except he will ſubmit himſelf to him, he will never take him into his houſe; He doth this, becauſe he knows the happineſs of his child lies in a ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdination to his father.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169957:167"/> Again, God doth it <hi>to put his people into a capacity of having and enjoying the things they ask:</hi> For what art thou fit for, O man? If thou comeſt to God as a petitioner, and come with thy heart lifted up againſt him, either the good thou deſireſt cannot come to thee, or it will come as a rod, and a ſnare; at the beſt it will be be bitterneſs to thy Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſider,</hi> Not to come in ſincerity, to yield your ſelves to God, is not to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Law of Prayer. When you come to ask of God, God then asks of you; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts are mutual and reciprocal: when you come to God, it is not your buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but God hath ſomething to treat with you about: It is fit if you ask, and would have God hear you, to have God grant your things; but you ſhould grant him his, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering he is free; He needs not give what thou askeſt, but thou art bound to give what he asketh; there is no proportion between that which thou askeſt of God, and that he asks of thee: God asks of thee to give up thy ſelf; and what art thou fit for? A creature more contemptible then a rotten Carkaſs that lies in a ditch: Wel, ſaith God, as bad as thou art, let me have thee, give up thy ſelf to me. And what doſt thou ask of God? Pardon and eternal life. Beſides, God ſpake
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169957:168"/> firſt: You come indeed and ask, but God ſpake firſt: Thou ſayſt, Lord, hear my prayer; but ſaith God, My words are gone out firſt, hear me. God prevents thee with requeſts, and hath been long waiting upon thee, that thou wouldſt come in, and give up thy ſelf to him.</p>
               <p>Conſider, what it is that you come for, what do you plead with God for? You would have God to be yours, to do you good to the utmoſt, not to withhold any good thing from you; then will you grant God this one requeſt, when you ask ſo many of him? You ask a thouſand things of God, God asks but this one of you, Give up your ſelves to him. You would have God to be yours for ever; if you ask ſo great things, is it not meet that you ſhould reſtore God his ancient Right? Surely God is full of grace and mercy unto his people; they can ſet their ſeals to this, that he is a God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer: See what an ingenuous acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment the Apoſtle makes of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.15. <hi>We know that he hears us, what ever we ask of him; and we know that we have the petition that we deſire of him.</hi> It's in effect as much as this, we can have what we will of God. You that walk with him, what is it that you may not get of him? You never come for any thing, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169957:168"/> go away empty; he hath not denyed you even to himſelf; therefore it much concerns you when you come to God, to give up your ſelves to him. Certainly this Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a work of a ſad import; we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign our ſelves, we muſt be Gods; we were his before: this imports that dreadful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that man hath exerciſed upon Gods patience, that ſhould humble us, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the work when we come to reſign our ſelves, becauſe we were before his.</p>
               <p>Let me ſhut up all with this Exhortation: That when you have been with God, and made this acknowledgment, that you are his, and have dealt in truth with God, and when God hath ſhew'd you the mercy you came for; now ſtand faſt in your own word, and perform it; break not your word with him to whom you have thus engag'd your ſelves. If you mind, you may have a true deſcription of your own ſpirits, you ſhall ſee the right face of them upon change of ſeaſons. Haſt thou been a begger in the day of thy diſtreſs? Art thou enlarged? Is the mercy come? Now obſerve thy ſpirit, now ſee what frame thy ſpirit is in towards God, when thy way is made ſmooth, and ſtorms are layd, and thou art at reſt. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, Men are very apt to promiſe in a day of trouble, Oh, upon a ſick bed, if God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169957:169"/> would reſtore me, I would walk more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with him; in a day of fear, what is more common then to ſay ſo? And as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. when they heard the Word of <hi>God</hi> repeated to them, they ſhut up all with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed willingneſs to ſubmit; and when the Curſe was read, all the people ſaid, <hi>Amen, ſo be it;</hi> but it was not ſo. In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. you have that wicked King coming to God, crouching before God, and offering himſelf before him, but it was not done effectually; what ever thoughts he had at that time that he would be the Lords, they went off again. Men come to God by the enforcement of diſtreſs, and ſay much, but are the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; they take up new words, but their hearts are what they were before. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I have planted thee a noble vine; I have broken the yoke, and burſt the bonds; thou ſaidſt, I will not tranſgreſs:</hi> But what was the temper and frame, what was the ſpirit of this people indeed? <hi>When under every high hill, and every green tree thou playeſt the harlot.</hi> She had a whoriſh and a wicked ſpirit, even then when ſhe ſaid to God, I'le not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. So in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.29. you ſee what a fair appearance there was: <hi>Joſiah</hi> being ſtir'd in ſpirit to think that the Lord God ſhould be ſo far out of ſight, and mind, and knowledg; and knowing what danger they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169957:169"/> were in, becauſe of neglecting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God; He humbled himſelf, and the people joyned with him, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves unto God, and there was great joy and alacrity among them, and there was ſuch an appearance, ſuch a Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as never had been: Notwithſtanding, at Chap. 26.16. it's ſaid, that <hi>they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his Word, and miſuſed his Prophets:</hi> So falſe are the hearts of men: It concerns you therefore to look to your intentions in this thing.</p>
               <p>Conſider, That <hi>the word is gone out of thy mouth;</hi> thou haſt promiſed to God, that thou wilt be his; if thou haſt not done it <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> thou haſt done it <hi>virtually:</hi> There is of the nature of a promiſe in all prayers: No man can come to God as a petitioner, but he comes with an acknowledgment of him as his Lord; therefore having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thou oughtſt to ſtand to it; a promiſe binds always, but chiefly in ſuch caſes as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where <hi>the thing we promiſed was due before it was promiſed:</hi> ſo was this; if thou haſt ſaid, thou wouldſt give thy ſelf to God, that was due before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where <hi>the performance of the promiſe brings no loſs</hi> or detriment; if thou fulfil thy promiſe, thou loſeſt not by it; thou parteſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169957:170"/> with nothing that will do thee good; in that thou thy ſelf becomeſt the Lords, it is thy perfection, and thy happineſs, it is a coming to the very ſtate of Angels. No creature can poſſibly be happy, but in a ſubordination to him that is the ſupream God, bleſſed for ever: Having promiſed therefore, make good thy word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, That <hi>by being with God, and having obtained the things you ſought for, you have now an advantage to walk as the Lords;</hi> to make good your word. Partly, <hi>becauſe your way is enlarged:</hi> It's a hard thing to walk with God in ways full of bryars and thorns; it's hard to walk through Seas of blood, and mighty ſtorms and tempeſts. But now when God ſmooths thy way, and removes thy fears, and gives thy ſpirit more compoſedneſs, it's a mighty advantage in thy hand, and therefore to be improved. <hi>David</hi> was of this ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run the ways of thy Commandments when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart:</hi> The meaning is, Fears and ſorrows compreſs and burden me, and make me walk heavily, as a man under a weight; but if thou wilt ſcatter theſe clouds, and deliver me from theſe ſtraits, and comfort my Soul; if thou wilt cheer, refreſh and enlarge me, then I will run thy ways; I'le not only walk in them, but walk
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169957:170"/> with all alacrity and celerity: <hi>I entered upon theſe words, when the ſword was upon the march, and fear was upon us terribly.</hi> Hath God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, delivered, and ſaved you? yea, are the clouds of blood ſcattered, and fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heads of our enemies? You have the deſire of your Souls; the bryars are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, your way is plain; now walk with God, fulfil your word to him, to whom you have given up your ſelves.</p>
               <p>This advantage alſo you have from the greatneſs of the mercy; <hi>Great mercies do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the Soul,</hi> renew, refreſh and enliven the Souls of men. Now, if God hath put thee upon the wing, defer not, but now up and be doing; pay thy vows before thy heart grow cold: It is a great thing to loſe impreſſions; when they are loſt, they are hardly regained. <hi>David</hi> lay long, before he was the ſame that he was before his fall; it coſt him much pains: It may be if thou grow cold again, that God will heat thee in a fiery furnace; He hath ways enough to viſit upon thee the neglects of the ſeaſons of grace. You may ſee how he expreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in anger againſt his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Wo to thee, for thou haſt fled from me; deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto thee, becauſe thou haſt tranſgreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; though I have redeemed them, they have ſpoken lyes againſt me; though I have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169957:171"/> ſtrengthened their arm, yet they have imagined evil againſt me.</hi> When a people are bound by mercies, and yet obey not, it diſpleaſeth. God was very angry with <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> for what? becauſe <hi>he did not return according to the mercies he had received.</hi> Surely the mercy you have received is great; it muſt be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by years and ages; it is not one mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but a multitude, a heap of mercies: Look how many miſchiefs the wrath of malicious men would have heaped upon you, look how many evils your own fearing hearts could deviſe and ſuggeſt; ſo many mercies are in this one. If therefore thou haſt ſought God, and God hath heard thee; remember when thou didſt come to God, thou didſt come upon ſuch terms, not to receive only, but to give: Thou haſt promiſed to be his, make good thy word: Thou didſt ſay in thy diſtreſs, <hi>I am thine, Lord, ſave me;</hi> ſay now in the day of thy deliverance, <hi>I am thine, Lord, for Thou haſt ſaved me.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The knowledg of Intereſt in God doth much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our approaches to God. It begets propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, carries the ſpirit in a due frame, fits it for all divine determinations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is yet ſomething more in the words worthy of our conſideration; <hi>[I am thine:]</hi> What's the fruits of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of God? his drawing near to God; <hi>I am thine, ſave me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The knowledg of our Intereſt in God doth much further our approaches to God. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                  </label> When a man is once aſſured, and can ſay with a clear ſpirit, <hi>I am thine;</hi> this man is a man of prayer, he is much in addreſſes to God, and converſing with him. I ſhall give you the ſence and import of this Point in theſe two or three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt; That when God out of his unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodneſs hath broke through the dark Cloud that was between him and us, and hath made this good to our hearts, that he is ours; <hi>this begets an inclination and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, an aptneſs to have recourſe to God, and converſe with him.</hi> A child that knows his father, though ſtrangers paſs by him, and take no notice of him; yet he loves to be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169957:172"/> with him; and the more he hath the nature of a child, the more he loves to be where his father is. So much more is the conjunction of the Soul with God, and the enjoyment of God, the portion of a child of God: there it loves to be; and, if it might, there it would be, and no where elſe. This Intereſt is ſuch, that it begets deſire upon deſire, that the Soul hath never enough of God; there is a conſtant ſpring of motion toward God, that makes the Soul to hang after him, as after that in which its life is. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. ſaith <hi>David, O God, thou art my God:</hi> What then? <hi>Early will I ſeek thee, my Soul thirſts for thee, my fleſh alſo longs for thee, &amp;c.</hi> Such a man needs not much driving, when he is himſelf; he is drawn of God, he needs not much to be driven by other things. <hi>[My Soul thirſts.]</hi> You need not force a thirſty beaſt to the river; do not withhold her, and ſhe will run her ſelf: There needs no Law to bind a man that is hungry to eat his meat; do but ſet meat before him, and he will eat willingly, he will not withhold his hands. That man that hath this ſealed up in his Soul, that God is his, cannot, nor will for ten thouſand worlds be held from communion with him; he breaks through all things; he accounts all other time (but what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) ill ſpent, in compariſon of that time
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169957:172"/> he ſpends with God: If he were at his own choyce, he would have no other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor be put upon any other ſervice, then to wait upon God, and be wholly his. An ingenuous child that carries his father in his heart, though at his fathers command he be content to go hither and thither, as <hi>David,</hi> to keep ſheep in the field; yet he had rather be at home, where he may ſpeak with his father, and hear his voyce, and have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. God is ſo good to his, that where once a man finds himſelf to be his, he finds ſuch ſtreams of mercy and goodneſs flowing forth, as knit his Soul to him. When he comes to him, he comes not as to a great God, but as to his own Father; and God entertains his not as ſtrangers, but as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with the entertainment of a Father: His entertainments are ſo ſweet, that they are new invitations; ſo that a man who hath been with God in a right ſpirit, is not glad that the time is paſt, but longs for that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to come again. Yea, God ſhews himſelf kind with the beſt advantage; kind in great things, and thoſe things that are the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of their Souls; thoſe things that men cannot be without, without pain, anguiſh, and bitterneſs of ſpirit, thoſe he gives. When their Souls are in trouble, then he eaſeth and comforteth them: How often have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169957:173"/> come to him in tears, heavineſs, and much mourning, and he hath wiped away their tears, and ſcattered the clouds that were about them, and given reſt to their Souls? In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my prayer, and the voyce of my ſupplication; becauſe he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. The ſorrows of death compaſſed me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and the pains of Hell caught hold on me; I found trouble and ſorrow, &amp;c.</hi> The force and ſpirit of it is this; I came to God in a ſad time, and God ſhewed me kindneſs ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; ſeeing he hath been ſo kind to me, I will call on him as long as I live, I'le go oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to him, I'le live in the preſence of God; I'le be much with him, becauſe of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Intereſt will carry a man according to the worth and ſufficiency that is in him, in whom he hath Intereſt, and according to his own wants and indigency.</hi> Now the Intereſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in God, is in one that is moſt glorious, and it's the Intereſt of ſuch as have moſt need: None can do for them what he can do. Now if a man have treaſure of his own, will he want? will he not go to it? If a man thirſt, and have rivers that run by him; if he have ſprings of his own, will he not drink of them? So it is with the people
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169957:173"/> of God; when they ſee God to be their God, they ſee all to be their own in God; and therefore will not ſuffer want, but will go to him. Yea, indeed the Intereſt of the people of God in God, is mingled with ſuch ingenuity, and ſuch a ſpirit of Love, that when they have not much cauſe to go to God <hi>as beggers,</hi> when neceſſity doth not pinch and enforce them, then they go upon <hi>friendly viſits.</hi> It's great content to a child to ſee his father, though he ask him nothing. It's great content to an ingenuous ſpirit to come to God as his friend, to behold him, and refreſh himſelf in that infinite glory wherewith he is clothed; though for the preſent he be not much pinched with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and ſtraits. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 5.7. <hi>As for me, I will come into thine houſe in the multitude of thy mercies. [In the multitude of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:]</hi> Not only that I will make this mine Argument, which I'le plead with thee, not that this ſhall be that on which my Soul ſhall lean; but even when thou art very good to me, in the multitude of thy mercies towards me will I come: not as others that come only when they need ſomething, but when thou art moſt gracious to me, then will I come. Thus the knowledg of a mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, works in his heart, an inward inclination and ſtrong propenſion to make
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169957:174"/> his addreſſes to God, and converſe with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The knowledg of this Intereſt, carries the ſpirit of a man to God, in a due frame and poſture;</hi> that is, it maintains the Soul in its addreſſes to God in joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, cheerfulneſs and hope; yet with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixtures of awful fear. A man that knows God to be his God, when he goes to him, he goes not as he to whom <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid, <hi>What doſt thou come to me as to a Lion?</hi> He comes not with that aſtoniſhment, dread and amazement that men do when their Conſciences are defiled, and in whoſe ſpirits the fire of Hell is. He is not afraid, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the infinite diſtance between God and him, to lift up his face before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: He comes with boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, when once he is in the ſight of this, that his name is written in the Book of Life, and that God hath taken him into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe whom he hath choſen out of the world. He comes and ſpeaks to God, and his language is as to one with whom he hath power: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.6. <hi>I will ſay unto the Lord, Thou art my God; hear the voyce of my ſupplication, O Lord.</hi> He tells you what lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he uſeth to God; I ſaid, Thou art my God, therefore hear me when I come unto thee: and this argument is very ſtrong. So
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169957:174"/> in <hi>Micah</hi> 7.7. you have the Church expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf thus; <hi>Therefore will I look to the Lord, and wait for the God of my Salvation; my God will hear me:</hi> The concluſion is very ſtrong. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.6. <hi>God, even our own God, ſhall bleſs us.</hi> When a man once comes to know that God hath taken him into the number of his, into his flock and fold; now ſaith he, God is mine, my own God ſhall bleſs me.</p>
               <p>That faith which makes a man ſee his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, makes him ſee that it's more to have an Intereſt in him, then to obtain all things from him; he therefore goes with courage to God, becauſe he hath obtained that already which is more then all comes to, that he ſhall have by asking. It was a greater favor for God to give us himſelf to be ours, then for him to give us a portion among the Angels in the glory of Heaven.</p>
               <p>God being our God, ſtands engaged; he is not his own, but ours alſo: therefore when a man ſees this, he comes to God for all things as to his own, and he comes for his own. As a child that is in want ſpeaks to his father for ſupplies; he ſpeaks to him, as one in whom he hath Intereſt, and pleads with ſuch a ſpirit, as knowing that he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hath intereſt in his fathers eſtate. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Intereſt is the beſt of all, it's found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169957:175"/> upon all Reaſon: Which ways ſoever a man comes to have Intereſt in another, ſo many ways hath God expreſt our Intereſt to be in him, and more alſo. By <hi>Creation; He hath made us, we are not our own,</hi> Pſal. 100.3. or, <hi>He hath made us, we are his.</hi> It's founded in <hi>Redemption;</hi> in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord that formed thee, O Jacob, and created thee, O Iſrael, Fear not, I have redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, I have called thee by name, thou art mine; I have made thee, and I have bought thee.</hi> It's likewiſe founded in that <hi>Union</hi> that we have with Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>God</hi> is become ours, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is become ours: The Sons Wife calls his Father, her Father; he is become a Father to her in his Son. If God takes notice of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon this account, that <hi>they were the ſeed of Abraham his friend;</hi> how much more will he own his people that are members of the body of his own Son? In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.8. <hi>Thou Iſrael art my ſervant, whom I have choſen, the ſeed of Abraham my friend.</hi> We become his, and he ours, by his actual admiſſion of us into the number of thoſe that are his own, and of the houſhold of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. They are ſaid to be <hi>a people near unto him, Pſal.</hi> 148.14. <hi>All Souls are mine,</hi> ſaith God in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. But thoſe whom he admits into his family, he takes peculiar notice of, and they are in a more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169957:175"/> eſpecial manner his. And alſo by <hi>actual Communion</hi> he becomes ours: As the wife becomes the husband's, not only by contract and marriage, and receiving her to his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but by actual communion: ſo we are the Lords, becauſe of that actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe that we have with God, and by his communication of thoſe fruits of his Love which he reſerves for his own. Thus then the knowledg of our Intereſt with God, clothes the ſpirit with fit diſpoſitions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in addreſſes unto God, as to joy and confidence. Now on the other ſide it works alſo in the Soul an awful reverential reſpect, ſuch as becomes the relation of a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his Maker, and that infinite diſtance that is between the high and holy One, and a lump of duſt; which alſo belongs to the true temper of a man in communion with God. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling, Pſal.</hi> 2. And <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I be a Maſter, where is my fear?</hi> It's a dangerous thing, for a man upon preſumption of his Intereſt in God, to have a boldneſs without a mixture of this fear and awfulneſs. Such joys are not from above, nor is it the Spirit of Truth that bears witneſs to them, when they do not lay the Soul much under God. Of all men, they come with the greateſt fear of God, that have the fulleſt knowledg of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169957:176"/> their Intereſt in God, and who have their hearts moſt ſpread with joy and gladneſs, becauſe God is become their Portion. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Wherefore receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi> That ſeems a ſtrange Inference, Having received a Kingdom, therefore ſerve God with fear: I, ſaith the Apoſtle, [therefore,] and God looks for it; and know if it be not done, there will be hazard in it, for our God is a conſuming fire. A ſtranger paſſeth by a man, and takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him; but a child that knows him to be his father, comes toward him with reſpect and honour; the very intereſt he hath in him, and the relation wherein he ſtands, ſtrikes on his ſpirit an awe towards his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So it is with thoſe that call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>See what account <hi>Nehemiah</hi> gives of his juſt walking, in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Other Rulers did ſo and ſo, but I did not; for I feared God.</hi> The aſſurance of the Love of God, and of a mans eternal life, begets fear; not <hi>that fear which hath torment,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; but it begets an awful caution and warineſs, as is meet in a buſineſs of ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He is more afraid to offend God, that knows God to be his God, then that man is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169957:176"/> whom God threatens every day with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death. Mark that of the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. It is ſpoken concerning the time when they ſhould be reſtored to a better ſtate; <hi>Afterwards ſhall the children of Iſrael return, and ſeek the Lord their God, and David their King; and ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs in the latter days. [Shall fear the Lord and his goodneſs.]</hi> No father is more feared of his child, then the beſt father, that walks towards his child in the greateſt wiſdom, goodneſs, meekneſs, and bounty. So that the kindneſs of God, and taſtes of his Love, do not lift up the Soul, and make it proud. That man is the moſt humble man in the world, that hath the moſt knowledg of the Love of God towards him in Jeſus Chriſt. This Fear and Faith do ſo ſtand together, that they cannot be ſeparated. In <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. <hi>They walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It's the right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a true Chriſtian, to have the comforts of God in his Soul, and yet to be with fear and trembling. It's a fear that doth inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ariſe upon a rectified nature, from a ſight of the diſproportion that is between God and us. This is in Heaven it ſelf, where the Angels in glory beholding God ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lifted up above them, cannot but have reverence, fear and dread in their Souls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169957:177"/> him. And it's a fear likewiſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; not the danger of eternal death, for from that they are ſaved, the knowledg of the Love of God aſſures them for that; but from the danger of other things, which to them are as bitter as death is to the world; and thoſe are the frowns of God, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of God, the ſuſpenſions of Love, and eſtrangedneſs of God towards them, the ſtripes of God: theſe things, when God doth as a Father to his that know him, they are moſt grievous and ſmarting; and their Souls groan under theſe more, then worldly men under worldly danger. Therefore he that knows God, and what it is to be in the light of his Countenance, he that hath taſted the bitterneſs of the loſs of this, lives in fear, leſt he ſhould provoke God as a Father to deal thus in ſeverity with him. And I ſpeak all this the rather, becauſe ſome do blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme that which is the ſpring of life and peace to the Saints, ſaying, That for a man to have the knowledg of God to be his God, and everlaſting Portion, is a ſnare to bring that man into a forgetfulneſs of God, and his Duty; and to blow up the ſpirit with pride, and lull him into a ſinful ſleep. Such like things as theſe have been and ſtill are (not without much cauſe of grief) caſt upon this bleſſed Doctrine of the knowledg of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169957:177"/> our abode with God: Whereas the true knowledg of God being ours, is that which doth effectually and firmly work the heart to all diligent watchfulneſs, tenderneſs and ſedulity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It diſpoſeth a mans ſpirit to the beſt entertainment of all divine Determinations that are upon a mans addreſſes to God upon any occaſion.</hi> Let the anſwer be what it may be, what ſeems good to God; that man that knows God to be his God, is beſt enabled to receive his anſwer, be it <hi>I</hi> or <hi>No:</hi> whether his prayer ſucceed or not, he is put into ſuch a frame, that he can ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the Will and Word of God; and go from God without murmuring and repining. If God hear him, he is glad, but yet not ſo glad of the thing, as of his Intereſt; he is not ſo taken with any thing he obtains, but God takes him more: If therefore he receives any thing, he rejoyceth in it as the fruit of Love, and makes a grateful return to God again. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.137. <hi>Save my Soul, and it ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> He rejoyceth in this, to ſee how welcome he is to God, and that his prayer is accepted; others come, and are not regarded, but he hath audience: The things that God gives out, to him have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form and taſte, then to the world; they come all with taſtes of love to him: <hi>In love
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169957:178"/> to my Soul,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezekiah, haſt thou delivered me,</hi> in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.17. And whatſoever he hath, he hath a better enjoyment of it then others, by reaſon of his Intereſt in God; he hath nothing from God as a meer gift, but he hath God with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God ſaith to that man that hath Intereſt in him, There, take that which thou askedſt for, and me with it; that is thine, and I am thine; and the enjoyment of God is more to him then all the world. This ſpirit is upon all that he hath, My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave me it, it is the fruit of the love of the God of my life; therefore I muſt uſe it in order, according to order from him, and not after my mind only. <hi>All things are beſt enjoyed when they are enjoyed according to Rule.</hi> We ſpoil the ſweeteſt things when we take them according to our wills, and ſo uſe them, then they become another thing. When a man can ſit in his enjoyment of all things, and ſee God, this is a drop from the Fountain of Life; and it is more then they have, that ſeem to enjoy a thouſand times more of the things of this life, whoſe corn and oyl increaſe.</p>
               <p>And if he be denyed, if God ſee it not good to give him the things he deſires, yet he is ſatisfied; he doth not contend with God, nor doth his ſpirit riſe up againſt his Maker; he hath a word ready in his ſpirit,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169957:178"/> Not my will, but thy Will be done; he ſaith, If my God will not give me this, it is well that he will give me himſelf; I may be without this, but I could not be without him; and ſeeing he hath given himſelf to be my Portion, I will wait with patience, and be content all the days of my life. In <hi>Eccleſs.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, If God give a man the joy of his Soul, he ſhall not much remember the days of his vanity.</hi> When God denies him any thing, he remembers that he comes not to God for this particular thing, but for the beſt good: We come not to God for any thing but that which is for our good. A good man ſaith, If I had this thing, it may be it would not do me good; and herein his ſpirit is ſatisfied: he ſaith, God knows bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I what is good for me; and if he thinks not ſuch a thing meet for me, I muſt think ſo too. So you ſee how the knowledg of a mans Intereſt furthers his approaches to God, and helps him in theſe three reſpects that we have mentioned.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the knowledg of divine Intereſt doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Holineſs, ſets Judgment and Nature againſt Sin, keeps the heart from inordinate reaching after and holding faſt preſent things. Faith binds the Soul, and keeps it bound, makes all a Chriſtians ways eaſie. Aſſurance gives a double advantage to our great meeting with God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN this Chapter I ſhall in ſome particulars ſhew how the knowledg of our Intereſt in God, doth promote and further our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God in all holineſs.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place: When a man hath taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe comforts that flow from this Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, <hi>Sin</hi> to that man <hi>is ſin indeed;</hi> it's out of meaſure ſinful. An aſſurance of our proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in God, repreſents ſin in its deepeſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and cauſeth it with the moſt afflicting reſemblance to reflect upon the ſpirit. The knowledg of our pardon doth not put an end to our ſorrows, it rather begins them. The ſight of God reconciled doth not work that peace that is without ſorrow, but makes thoſe ſtreams run deeper and purer. The more a man knows that he ſhall not dye for ſin, the more he is under a neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169957:179"/> his ſin; and it's as natural an effect of the ſight of God, to have the heart pierced and wounded, as healed. <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> told him, that he had ſinned, and when he knew that his ſin was done away, then was he moſt candid, moſt ſerious, and ſtrong in his humiliation before God. Thoſe men that pretend to have their joys from their pardon, and reckon God to be theirs, and yet can paſs over their ſins with dry eyes, drink their refreſhing waters not from him who is the Well of Life, but from beneath, and are under a ſpirit of depravation and deluſion, and ſuch a ſpirit as will ſeal them up to everlaſting condemnation. Nothing becomes the Saints more then mourning. The proper working of love in Heaven, is joy, becauſe there is nothing but good; but the proper working of love here, is joy with grief, becauſe though God be good to us, yet we are evil againſt him. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. you have this expreſſion by God himſelf; <hi>Then ſhall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ſhall loath your ſelves for your iniquities, and for your abominations. [Then:]</hi> When? If you look in the verſes before, it is when God ſhould come to do them the greateſt good, when he would cauſe his face to ſhine upon them, and make his footſteps to drop down
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169957:180"/> bleſſings: Then, ſaith God, when I have you upon the knee, and ſatisfied your Souls with goodneſs; then ſhall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that have not been good; and you ſhall loath your ſelves for all your abominations. The knowledg of abſolution in Heaven, breeds the ſevereſt condemnation in the hearts of the Saints; the more they ſee they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the more that voyce ſounds in their ears, Thou art <hi>comely and fair,</hi> my Beloved; the more do they point at <hi>their ſpots,</hi> and have an eye upon their own ſpirits; <hi>I am black,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>the Sun hath ſtained my beauty,</hi> though God ſaid ſhe was <hi>all fair and comely.</hi> Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Paul, Thou art a choſen Veſſel:</hi> What ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf all along? <hi>I was a Perſecutor, and a Blaſphemer, &amp;c.</hi> He read it as if it were wrote in a table al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before his eyes. Not only ſin in act, but ſin in temptation, the very ſolicitations to ſin, are grievous to that man that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a teſtimony from Heaven, that his name is written in the Book of Life, and that God, whoſe Name is, <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> is his God and Father. Remember <hi>Joſeph</hi> what he ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great evil, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Above all, ſin in their nature, as it dwells in them, and acts in them inceſſantly, and renders them in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169957:180"/> ſuch a contrariety to the Nature and Will of God, this is that which doth mightily humble and abaſe them; not only as it is diſpleaſing to God, but alſo as it puts them into an incapacity of ſerving him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving communion with him. The more ſin is in us, the leſs we ſee of God. <hi>Matthew</hi> 5. verſ. 8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God. [See him,]</hi> not only in Heaven, but as they are pure and are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, as they are more filled with the ſpirit of holineſs, ſo they ſhall have clear vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God, and more full acquaintance with God here. Now the aſſurance of our Intereſt in God making ſin to be thus vile, and ſetting the Soul at ſuch a diſtance from it, is a great furtherance to holineſs: It ſets the judgment againſt it, and not only the judgment, for ſo it may be in the worſt of men, but it puts the nature of the man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. A child knows in his judgment he ought not to wound his father; but there is ſomething in his nature that he cannot do it, beſides the over-powering force of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: As <hi>Eſther</hi> in Chap. 8.6. expreſſeth this natural force, <hi>How can I endure to ſee the evil that ſhall come upon my people?</hi> or, <hi>how can I endure to ſee the deſtruction of my kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred?</hi> See how reſolution wrought with her; <hi>[How can I endure,]</hi> how can I endure
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169957:181"/> to ſee theſe things? So ſaith the Soul that hath a ſight of God, How can I do thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? That's one thing.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place; The knowledg of this bleſſedneſs, that God is become ours, <hi>calms, quiets, and moderates the heart towards all things:</hi> So that there is neither that inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacy of <hi>reaching after</hi> or <hi>holding faſt</hi> theſe preſent things, as there was before. Beſides this, it works an holy contentment in our preſent eſtate, an holy indifferency to any future poſſible condition according to the Will and Wiſdom of God. When once a man hath taſted of this Intereſt, and hath ſeen the favour of the great God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, he looks no more after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lovers, but ſhakes them off according to the meaſure he hath attained. As in a houſe more noble things take place, and duſt and things of no value are caſt out: ſo when this Pearl of infinite worth takes place in the Soul, when once a man lives in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, he dyes ſo far to all things elſe. In <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. ſaith the Apoſtle (having ſaid before that Chriſt lived in him) <hi>I am crucified to the world, and the world is crucified to me:</hi> The world looks on me as a dead thing, with whom it would not converſe; and I look on the world as a dead corps, and have nothing to do with it, it is of no value
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169957:181"/> with me. When <hi>Ruth</hi> was married to <hi>Boaz,</hi> ſhe forſook the field, and gleaned no more; when ſhe had got <hi>Boaz</hi>'s eſtate, ſhe minded no more to gather handfulls of Corn by gleaning. If any man (ſaith Chriſt) drink of theſe waters, he ſhall never thirſt; he ſhall not need to dig any other pits, theſe waters ſhall content him; his deſires ſhall be ſo confined, contented and contracted to this one thing. A mans intereſt in one is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the perſon in whom it is: He that hath intereſt in a Prince, will not be drawn away by beggers. When <hi>Saul</hi> had found a Kingdom, he minded no more the Aſſes which he was ſeeking. When the people of God had freedom to come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they were willing to leave <hi>Babylon.</hi> This is a great piece of holineſs, for a man to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from this world in his affections, that he can ſteer through the world untouched, that he may be in the uſe of creatures, but not come in bonds under the power, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and force of them: Now when a man ſees God to be his God, this makes him to be as Chriſt ſpeaks of his, <hi>They are not of this world, as I am not of this world, Joh.</hi> 17. This comfort diſſolves all bonds, and ſets free from a confederacy with other things, and now the whole world is of little force with him. <hi>Moſes</hi> is a pregnant example of
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:169957:182"/> this in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.24. <hi>By faith</hi> Moſes <hi>when he was come to years</hi> (or when <hi>he became great) refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> What was the Reaſon? The Text gives you theſe Reaſons, <hi>that he had reſpect to the recompence of reward,</hi> at the twenty ſixth Verſe, and <hi>becauſe he had ſeen him who was inviſible,</hi> at the 27. Verſe; So that the ſight of God, and the ſight of our Intereſt in him, lays the world dead, caſts a darkneſs upon the glory of it; and the ſoul is taken with nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſight of our Intereſt <hi>holds the ſoul in bonds unto God,</hi> it doth <hi>not onely bind it, but hold it bound. The love of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>conſtrains us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14. It holds us to God, that though there be ſomething in us that makes us apt to excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to go out from him, yet we are held in by bonds of love. This Intereſt muſt needs be of a mighty force to thoſe that ſee it, becauſe its the higheſt Intereſt in the ſweeteſt way: God gives us ſuch an Intereſt in himſelf, as a child hath in his Father, and as a Spouſe hath in her husband; which are Intereſts of greateſt Love. Its an Intereſt of conſtant communion, there are conſtant
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169957:182"/> effluxes, out-flowings of the kindneſs of God upon that ſoul, that knows God to be his; which do bind him every day more and more, and leave him leſs his own. This is the nature of the Spirit of Adoption, that makes a man cry <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> it makes him more a child; as willing to acknowledg himſelf in that ſtate of ſubordination, as a child; as he is to look up to God in a way of hope, as he is the Father of mercies.</p>
               <p>The aſſurance of the love of God as it <hi>comforts,</hi> ſo <hi>it conquers</hi> the ſoul. It doth not work it into a ſtrange kind of <hi>mad rejoycing,</hi> ſuch as the Spirit that is gone forth begets in the hearts of many at this day, who are ſtrangers to the life of God, yet boaſt as if they had drunk deep of the cup of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas they are looſe and careleſs, and can do all evil againſt God, and be free from him, and not have their hearts touch'd with it at all. But now true Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that which he who is the God of all comfort gives, by the manifeſtation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in conjunction with the creature, doth overcome the heart, and put it into a willing neceſſity, and ſtrengthens it to walk in all well-pleaſing before him, ſo that the ſoul cannot go from him. In <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth this, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt been my help, therefore in the ſhadow of thy wings
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169957:183"/> will I rejoyce, my ſoul cleaveth unto thee, for thy right hand upholdeth me.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Thou haſt done me good, and thine hand hath ſupported me, elſe I ſhould fall at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtep; I live upon thee, therefore my ſoul followeth after thee, or is glued to thee; the expreſſion of thy love and conſtant goodneſs towards me is that which binds my ſoul unto thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When a man knows God to be his God, and there is no more remembrance of ſin againſt him, and that he is received into the inheritance of the Saints, and of Chriſt himſelf; and that God is become his Father; <hi>Now all his ways are made eaſie, this facilitates all.</hi> For what are thoſe things that are wont to burden a mans ſpirit in the race which is ſet before him? It is either becauſe there are ſuch <hi>ſad things in his way,</hi> or becauſe a man fears whether <hi>his work and ſervice ſhall be accepted,</hi> or becauſe he doth not <hi>like his work,</hi> or becauſe he is not ſatisfied <hi>about his wages;</hi> Now it is manifeſt that the knowledg of this, that God is our God, removes all theſe things; he cannot diſlike his way that ſees God in it, he cannot diſlike that work which God ſets him about, he cannot but think he is accepted, and that his wages is more then ſufficient recompence, that knows God to be his God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3, 4. the Apoſtle ſaith,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169957:183"/> 
                  <hi>That to him that loves, the Commandment is not grievous.</hi> It is no burthen in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; ſo far as a man loves, ſo far his work is eaſie and ſweet to him: What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Its given in the next words follwing, <hi>Becauſe he hath overcome the world,</hi> for there is nothing except darkneſs upon a mans ſpirit, which is a ſpring of fear and doubt, concerning his acceptance with God, that clogs a mans ſpirit in the ways of God, that ſharpens and imbitters the things which we muſt grapple withall; I ſay, nothing can hurt him but this: Now a man that ſees God to be his God, hath overcome the world. And if his caſe be dangerous, ſuch wherein he is tempted on the right hand, he ſaith with <hi>Paul,</hi> I paſs not, I care not for all theſe things, as <hi>Moſes</hi> cared not for all the riches of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court. And as <hi>Paul</hi> when he was tempted upon the left hand, I paſs not for all theſe things neither ſhame, trouble, reproach, ſtripes, impriſonments, and the like. And <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4.16. In that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the people of God, I ſee (ſaith ſhe) it's the will of God I ſhould do it, Ile go, and <hi>If I periſh, I periſh;</hi> ſuch an impreſſion doth the ſight of God leave upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that nothing can ſtop the ſoul in its courſe, no more then the Sun in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Others go heavy and are ſoon tyred,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169957:184"/> as God complains in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. <hi>They ſay alſo, What a wearineſs is it?</hi> that is, to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in his worſhip: <hi>And they ſnuff at it,</hi> in way of diſlike, or as men that would blow away ſomething which lies in their way, and which they diſlike. Upon all theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations nothing promotes holineſs more then the knowledg of this, that God is ours. To that which hath been ſaid, I will only add a double advantage that this aſſurance gives to our meeting with God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>it doth allay that unquietneſs that is ready to riſe upon the thoughts of diſſolution,</hi> and the remembrance of that day of Doom, when one word determines a mans eſtate to all Eternity. To know that a man is going to his God and Father, to be able to ſay, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I go to my Father;</hi> this will baniſh thoſe fears from the Soul, and make a man to go out of the body with peace, as one that knows whether he is going, even out of an unquiet Sea to a quiet Harbor, which he ſees fair before him, and where he ſhall be free from danger. This is that which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Herein is love made perfect,</hi> the love of God is herein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, hath its utmoſt ſweetneſs, efficacy and operation, <hi>that we may have boldneſs in the day of Judgment.</hi> It doth ſecure and quiet our ſpirits, and doth anſwer all ſad thoughts
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169957:184"/> of the Soul; that we may have boldneſs in that day, <hi>becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world:</hi> Becauſe as he is faithful and real in his love to us, ſo we are faithful and real in our love to him; ſo that there is a firm uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conjunction between God and us.</p>
               <p>Another Advantage is, that <hi>Aſſurance makes the heart to long after God, and to be with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That moſt aſſured Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was by faith put into this temper, and having a ſight of thoſe things within the vail, and looking at them as before him; how abundantly (as one burdened) doth he groan and ſigh that he may be in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe things whereof he had a ſight and hope? So that it is of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, for a man to know God to be his God in reference to his appearance before him at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>My Exhortation to you all therefore ſhall be, That you would labor to make your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt certain, that you may be able to ſay with <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer lives;</hi> and as <hi>David</hi> in the Text, <hi>I am thine.</hi> A man cannot be a good man that drives not after this; he knows not God at all, that hath no deſire of this aſſurance. That man alſo, what ever he knows of God, is in a ſad, miſerable and wretched condition, that doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be his God; that lives floating
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169957:185"/> between hope and fear, and yet lives without vehement deſires and endeavors to have this queſtion cleared. Certainly you cannot be right, if you have not ſuch a deſire of the enjoyment of this Intereſt, to be able to ſay, <hi>God is my God.</hi> This we are to ſeek in truth and purity; not to the quieting of our ſpirits only, or to the indulgence of the fleſh, (as many ſeem to long after the conſolations of God, that know not what they are,) but that God having ſo filled us, we may become a ſacrifice to him. You muſt effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute this alſo in the utmoſt improvement of your might and power, without ceaſing, till you have obtained it, till you have that word ſealed up in your Souls, <hi>Son, daughter, be of good comfort, for thy ſins are forgiven thee; lift up thy head, for thy Maker is thy Husband.</hi> It is the greateſt folly in the world for Chriſtians to pretend a life of faith, and cut the life and ſinews of juſt and neceſſary endeavors for the attaining aſſurance of the love of God. A man ſhould take heed of preſuming upon God when he cannot ſay, <hi>God is his God;</hi> and he muſt take heed of pretending to live a life of faith in ſuch a way that weakens his endeavors after aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Certainly, the ſame principle that carries a man from the world to God, will make a man reſtleſs till he knows that God
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169957:185"/> is his God, and what things are contained in that Intereſt: which things, as it is a great grief not to know, ſo if they be clouded, it is uſually from Gods diſpleaſure, by which the Soul is left fluctuating, toſſing, rouling and waſting it ſelf in anxieties, clouds and perplexing doubts. I ſay not, that it's always from diſpleaſure, becauſe God hath other ends then he hath acquainted us withall; yet I ſay, uſually it is ſo. But as a wiſe father full of bowels, if he be ſtrange to his child, or take any relation of love, if it be clouded and darkened, it uſually betokens all is not well, ſomething is amiſs. So I ſay, thou mayſt juſtly ſuſpect, and take occaſion to make a ſearch, what is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and thee; and what is the cauſe of thoſe clouds that are interpoſed between God and thy Soul. In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.8. God tells us the ſpring of this evil, <hi>In a little wrath, for a moment I hid my face. [In a little wrath.]</hi> So that the ſuſpending of comfort from our ſpirits, leaving the Souls of men dubious and anxious about this great matter, doth uſually betoken diſpleaſure, all is not well.</p>
